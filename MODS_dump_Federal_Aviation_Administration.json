In this study, structural information of individual species within Virent’s Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK) is identified by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopy. By mass, 71.3% of the components elute within six peaks of the chromatogram, from which 12 unique species are identified through a novel deconvolution method. Overall, the identification of 93.6%m across 26 structural isomers is made by the methods described in this work. With 93.6%m ascribed to specific isomers, the precision of fuel property predictions improves dramatically. For example, the absolute error of the viscosity prediction is reduced by 90% because of this advancement in diagnostic capability, and its 95-percentile confidence interval (precision only) is reduced by 93%. Additionally, the properties of SAK, blended with hydro processed esters fatty acids (HEFA), are demonstrated to have blended properties consistent with conventional jet fuel."],

          "This research explores an advanced method of fuel composition determination and builds upon typical hydrocarbon group type analyses performed with two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC). In this study, structural information of individual species within Virent’s Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK) is identified by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopy. By mass, 71.3% of the components elute within six peaks of the chromatogram, from which 12 unique species are identified through a novel deconvolution method. Overall, the identification of 93.6%m across 26 structural isomers is made by the methods described in this work. With 93.6%m ascribed to specific isomers, the precision of fuel property predictions improves dramatically. For example, the absolute error of the viscosity prediction is reduced by 90% because of this advancement in diagnostic capability, and its 95-percentile confidence interval (precision only) is reduced by 93%. Additionally, the properties of SAK, blended with hydro processed esters fatty acids (HEFA), are demonstrated to have blended properties consistent with conventional jet fuel."],

Here we model the effects of demand-side restrictions on high-deforestation palm oil in Europe on deforestation and emissions in Indonesia. We do so by integrating a model of global trade with a spatially explicit model of land-use change in Indonesia. We estimate a European ban on high-deforestation palm oil from 2000 to 2015 would have led to a 8.9% global price premium on low-deforestation palm oil, resulting in 21 374 ha yr−1 (1.60%) less deforestation and 21.1 million tCO2 yr−1 (1.91%) less emissions from deforestation in Indonesia relative to what occurred. A hypothetical Indonesia-wide carbon price would have achieved equivalent emission reductions at $0.81/tCO2. Impacts of a ban are small because: 52% of Europe’s imports of high-deforestation palm oil would have shifted to non-participating countries; the price elasticity of supply of high-deforestation oil palm cropland is small (0.13); and conversion to oil palm was responsible for only 32% of deforestation in Indonesia.

This modeling approach may also include the preprocessing and storage of feedstocks at depots. Labor/salary requirements and renewable identification number (RIN) values and credits attributable to the conversion facility, along with land-use changes for growing the feedstock are also included in the supply chain analyses. The investment and annual operating of renewable energy technologies for electricity generation for wind, solar, and digesters are modeled as well. Recent modeling emphasis has centered on the supply chain for liquid fuels using the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s 179 economic trading areas as modeling regions. These various data layers necessary to estimate the economic impact are contained in UT’s renewable energy economic analysis layers (REEAL) modeling system. This analysis provides an example scenario to demonstrate REEAL’s modeling capabilities. The conversion technology modeled is a gasification Fischer–Tropsch biorefinery with feedstock input of 495,000 metric tons per year of forest residue transported to a logging road that is less than one mile in distance. The biorefinery is expected to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), diesel, and naphtha. An estimated one million tons of forest residue are required at fifty percent moisture content. Based on a technical economic assessment (TEA) developed by the Aviation Sustainability Center (ASCENT) and the quantity of hardwood residues available in the Central Appalachian region, three biorefineries could be sited each utilizing 495,000 dry metric tons per year. Each biorefinery could produce 47.5 million liters of SAF, 40.3 million liters of diesel, and 23.6 million liters of naphtha. Annual gross revenues for fuel required for the biorefineries to break even are estimated at $193.7 million per biorefinery. Break-even plant gate fuel prices when assuming RINs and 12.2 percent return on investment are $1.12 per liter for SAF, $1.15 per liter for diesel, and $0.97 per liter for naphtha. Based on IMPLAN, an input–output model, and an investment of $1.7 billion, the estimated economic annual impact to the Central Appalachian region if the three biorefineries are sited is over a half a billion dollars. Leakages occur as investment dollars leaving the region based on the regions local purchase coefficients (i.e., LPPs), which totals $500 million. This results in an estimated $2.67 billion in economic activity with a multiplier of 1.7, or for every million dollars spent, an additional $0.7 million in economic activity is generated in the regional economy. Gross regional product is estimated at $1.28 billion and employment of nearly 1,200 jobs are created during the construction period of the biorefineries, which results in $700 million in labor income with multiplier effects. Economic activity for the feedstock operations (harvesting and chipping) is estimated at slightly more than $16.8 million resulting in an additional $30 million in the economic impact. The stumpage and additional profit occurring from the harvest of the forest residues result in $40 million directly into the pockets of the resource and logging operation owners. Their subsequent expenditures resulted in a total economic activity increase of $71.4 million. These operations result in creating an estimated 103 direct jobs for a total of 195 with multiplier effects. Direct feedstock transportation expenditures of more than $36.7 million provide an estimated increase in economic activity of almost $68 million accounting for the multiplier effects."],

To date, SAF, especially from cellulosic feedstocks, have struggled to overcome two barriers: (1) meeting price parity with their petroleum counterparts and (2) the large capital investment required for industrial-scale biorefineries. Repurposing of industrial facilities has been suggested as a means of addressing both challenges. In this study we look at the financial impact of manufacturing SAF using three repurposing value levels. To demonstrate the application of this methodology, we examine case studies based on a wood-based alcohol-to-jet process. Each level evaluated assumes a different portion of the existing facility is useable. The impact on capital costs and minimum fuel selling price is estimated for generalized case studies as well as for specific case studies spread across multiple regions of the USA. The best economic outcomes are achieved when large-scale facilities have both inside and outside battery limit assets that can be repurposed. The geospatially explicit variables that have the largest economic impact are feedstock price, feedstock composition, and industrial natural gas price. However, the scale and value of repurposing both outweigh the geospatial variables within reasonable limits. Of the locations studied, the lowest minimum selling price (MSP) of $1.16/L was calculated at the Washington facility, a nearly 19% reduction from a matching scaled greenfield facility, a result of existing equipment and infrastructure reducing total capital investment by one-third and plentiful feedstock."],

          "Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is vital for the reduction of the environmental impact of the aviation industry while decreasing the dependence of the USA on foreign petroleum fuels. To date, SAF, especially from cellulosic feedstocks, have struggled to overcome two barriers: (1) meeting price parity with their petroleum counterparts and (2) the large capital investment required for industrial-scale biorefineries. Repurposing of industrial facilities has been suggested as a means of addressing both challenges. In this study we look at the financial impact of manufacturing SAF using three repurposing value levels. To demonstrate the application of this methodology, we examine case studies based on a wood-based alcohol-to-jet process. Each level evaluated assumes a different portion of the existing facility is useable. The impact on capital costs and minimum fuel selling price is estimated for generalized case studies as well as for specific case studies spread across multiple regions of the USA. The best economic outcomes are achieved when large-scale facilities have both inside and outside battery limit assets that can be repurposed. The geospatially explicit variables that have the largest economic impact are feedstock price, feedstock composition, and industrial natural gas price. However, the scale and value of repurposing both outweigh the geospatial variables within reasonable limits. Of the locations studied, the lowest minimum selling price (MSP) of $1.16/L was calculated at the Washington facility, a nearly 19% reduction from a matching scaled greenfield facility, a result of existing equipment and infrastructure reducing total capital investment by one-third and plentiful feedstock."],

Well trained air traffic controllers using effective automation can exploit alarms, alerts and warnings (collectively, signals) to build situation awareness and to lessen cognitive workload. The goal of this project is to develop a handbook that will guide air traffic system designers and controller user teams as they collaborate with human factors experts to create or modify air traffic control system alarms, alerts, and warnings. During the first two phases of the project, we have summarized the existing literature on alarms, alerts, and warnings and developed a signaling philosophy. We have now developed a signal taxonomy that can be used to evaluate an existing ATC signal or design a new signal using an objective scoring sheet and a structured interview format with subject matter experts (i.e., air traffic controllers) during the design process. This framework will provide relevant personnel with a common language that allows them to describe, classify, and objectively evaluate signals in air traffic control. After the handbook has been completed, our recommendations will be tested and validated with air traffic controllers during Phase 4. Phase 5 of the project will include further refinement of the signaling handbook as necessary and the development of training materials. At the conclusion of this project, the Air Traffic Organization will have the tools necessary to develop signals that will help to keep the United States’ National Airspace System the safest in the world."],

          "The Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic control organization (ATO) encompasses a variety of facilities that include towers, terminal radar approach control facilities (TRACONs), and air route traffic control centers (ARTCCs). Well trained air traffic controllers using effective automation can exploit alarms, alerts and warnings (collectively, signals) to build situation awareness and to lessen cognitive workload. The goal of this project is to develop a handbook that will guide air traffic system designers and controller user teams as they collaborate with human factors experts to create or modify air traffic control system alarms, alerts, and warnings. During the first two phases of the project, we have summarized the existing literature on alarms, alerts, and warnings and developed a signaling philosophy. We have now developed a signal taxonomy that can be used to evaluate an existing ATC signal or design a new signal using an objective scoring sheet and a structured interview format with subject matter experts (i.e., air traffic controllers) during the design process. This framework will provide relevant personnel with a common language that allows them to describe, classify, and objectively evaluate signals in air traffic control. After the handbook has been completed, our recommendations will be tested and validated with air traffic controllers during Phase 4. Phase 5 of the project will include further refinement of the signaling handbook as necessary and the development of training materials. At the conclusion of this project, the Air Traffic Organization will have the tools necessary to develop signals that will help to keep the United States’ National Airspace System the safest in the world.",

This report contains sections describing a literature review, an engineering analysis methods and results, and recommendations. The literature review covers an overview of differences in human-machine interface (HMI) among the platform types, LOADABLE ATC clearances, equipage levels among new generation and legacy Boeings, data entry checking features, and a section on new technology that may impact CPDLC in the future. The engineering analysis sections describe the analysis methodology and the results of observed capabilities and limitations for each Boeing platform based on the simulator analysis. The recommendations section includes recommendations for CPDLC crew procedures, compliance with CPDLC procedures, system design, and future research. Both manual and autoloading CPDLC functions were evaluated in a real-time nominal ‘flight.’ A variety of air traffic control (ATC) uplink message (UM) elements were selected based on clearance auto-loading into the flight management system (FMS), message complexity and category. Message categories included concatenated, conditional and route modification, speed, altitude, and time (Required Time of Arrival (RTA)) messages. The analysis used several platforms, including first generation FMS and glass cockpit aircraft and newer generation aircraft with graphical user interface (GUI) displays and cursor controls. Aircraft used in the study included the Boeing 787, Boeing 777, Boeing 744, and the Boeing-733. An important consideration was to understand the proper task sequences in retrieving and responding to each ATC uplink message so that error-free and compatible procedures could be developed. Once an ATC uplink was sent to the on-board CPDLC system, it was necessary to understand all the crew tasks required to retrieve the message, evaluate the clearance, and configure the automation to execute the clearance. Only ATC uplink clearances were evaluated."],

This report contains sections describing a literature review, an engineering analysis methods and results, and recommendations. The literature review covers an overview of differences in human-machine interface (HMI) among the platform types, LOADABLE ATC clearances, equipage levels among new generation and legacy Boeings, data entry checking features, and a section on new technology that may impact CPDLC in the future. The engineering analysis sections describe the analysis methodology and the results of observed capabilities and limitations for each Boeing platform based on the simulator analysis. The recommendations section includes recommendations for CPDLC crew procedures, compliance with CPDLC procedures, system design, and future research. Both manual and autoloading CPDLC functions were evaluated in a real-time nominal ‘flight.’ A variety of air traffic control (ATC) uplink message (UM) elements were selected based on clearance auto-loading into the flight management system (FMS), message complexity and category. Message categories included concatenated, conditional and route modification, speed, altitude, and time (Required Time of Arrival (RTA)) messages. The analysis used several platforms, including first generation FMS and glass cockpit aircraft and newer generation aircraft with graphical user interface (GUI) displays and cursor controls. Aircraft used in the study included the Boeing 787, Boeing 777, Boeing 744, and the Boeing-733. An important consideration was to understand the proper task sequences in retrieving and responding to each ATC uplink message so that error-free and compatible procedures could be developed. Once an ATC uplink was sent to the on-board CPDLC system, it was necessary to understand all the crew tasks required to retrieve the message, evaluate the clearance, and configure the automation to execute the clearance. Only ATC uplink clearances were evaluated.",

        "mods.abstract":["Aviation emissions are responsible for an estimated 24,000 premature mortalities annually and 3.5% of anthropogenic radiative forcing (RF). Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides (NOx and SOx) contribute to these impacts. However, the relative contributions and mechanisms linking these emissions to formation and impacts of secondary aerosols (as opposed to direct aerosol emissions) have not been quantified, including how short-lived aerosol precursors at altitude can increase surface-level aerosol concentrations. We apply global chemistry transport modeling to identify and quantify the different chemical pathways to aerosol formation from aviation emissions, including the resulting impact on radiative forcing. We estimate a net aerosol radiative forcing of –8.3 mWm−2, of which –0.67 and –7.8 mWm−2 result from nitrate and sulfate aerosols respectively. We find that aviation NOx causes –1.7 mWm−2 through nitrate aerosol forcing but also –1.6 mWm−2 of sulfate aerosol forcing by promoting oxidation of SO2 to sulfate aerosol. This accounts for 21% of the total sulfate forcing, and oxidation of SO2 due to aviation NOx is responsible for 47% of the net aviation NOx attributable RF. Aviation NOx emissions in turn account for 41% of net aviation-aerosol-attributable RF (non-contrail). This is due to ozone-mediated oxidation of background sulfur and the 'nitrate bounce-back' effect, which reduces the net impact of sulfur emissions. The ozone-mediated mechanism also explains the ability of cruise aviation emissions to significantly affect surface aerosol concentrations. We find that aviation NOx emissions cause 72% of aviation-attributable, near-surface aerosol loading by mass, compared to 27% from aviation SOx emissions and less than 0.1% from direct emission of black carbon. We conclude that aviation NOx and SOx emissions are the dominant cause of aviation-attributable secondary inorganic aerosol radiative forcing, and that conversion of background aerosol precursors at all altitudes is amplified by enhanced production of aviation attributable oxidants at cruise altitudes."],

Similar flows appear in numerous applications and feature a vibrant range of topological and dynamical characteristics associated with phenomena including shear layer separation and vortex breakdown. Our results begin by describing the non-monotonic evolution of the axisymmetric jet’s steady topology under varying S. In accord with earlier reports, the jet progresses through a sequence of wake, breakdown and wall jet regimes in a qualitatively similar manner across a wide span of d and Re values. In the wake regime, the non-swirling jet bifurcates to a plane-symmetric, but not axisymmetric, steady flow pattern beyond a d-dependent critical Re value. With further increase in Re, the steady non-swirling jet destabilises subsequently via multiple distinct Hopf bifurcations. Introducing S > 0 to the jet also induces unsteadiness by twisting the singly azimuthally periodic (|m| = 1) asymmetric wake structure and causing it to precess periodically in time about the central axis. Intermediate swirl stabilises this unsteady dynamics and restores the jet’s axisymmetry. This stabilising effect is then reversed in the breakdown regime at higher S, where a variety of different |m| = 1 and |m| = 2 instabilities bifurcate from the steady flow as S is increased. Several instances of hysteresis and subcritical behaviour are reported and discussed, including one that manifests precessing vortex core oscillations."],

We obtained feedback from pilots on how well the prototyped interfaces supported pilot decision making, how easy they were to learn, their effect on self-reported workload, and the way in which the information was presented. Results: Evaluation participants responded favorably to the MCDU and integrated GFP RTA-prototypes, while the EFB prototype received less favorable feedback. However, the data collected in this study must be considered preliminary, until we have completed more rigorous human factors evaluation and objective pilot performance measurements. The report concludes with our recommendations for further work to develop and refine recommendations for TBO flight deck design requirements and guidance, including refinement and evaluation of EFB design that could support legacy aircraft participation in TBO."],

        "mods.abstract":["Social science has an important role in aviation biofuels research, yet social science methods and approaches tend to be underdeveloped and under-utilized in the broader aviation biofuels literature and biofuels overall. Over the last 5 years, social science approaches in aviation biofuels research, particularly site-selection, have made several advances. Where early site-selection models either entirely excluded social science concepts or included only a few measurements using poor proxies, current models more accurately, and more comprehensively capture key social science concepts to better examine and predict project implementation success and long-term sustainability. Despite several studies published within the last 20 years noting the need for more empirical studies of social sustainability and improvement in incorporation of social criteria, progress has remained rather stagnant in several areas. To help move the field forward, we conduct a review of the current state of social science research in aviation biofuels with a focus on sustainability, site-selection, and public acceptance research, identifying key approaches, important developments, and research gaps and weaknesses of current approaches. While several review studies already exist, they tend to focus on a single area of biofuels such as public acceptance. By broadening our review to several areas, we are able to identify several common limitations across these areas that contribute to the continued underutilization of social science approaches in aviation biofuels. This includes the preference for practical and reliable indicators for social criteria that prioritize quantitative methods over other approaches. Based on these limitations, we make several recommendations to improve social science research in aviation biofuels, including ensuring that social scientists are key members of the research team, the adoption of a mixed-methods research designs that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches that better measure some criteria and local-level impacts, and adequate resources for social science research throughout biofuel development projects as these methods are often more time-consuming and costly to implement. We argue that implementing these recommendations in future aviation biofuel development projects will improve social science approaches utilized in aviation biofuels research and address a long acknowledged gap in the field."],

          "Social science has an important role in aviation biofuels research, yet social science methods and approaches tend to be underdeveloped and under-utilized in the broader aviation biofuels literature and biofuels overall. Over the last 5 years, social science approaches in aviation biofuels research, particularly site-selection, have made several advances. Where early site-selection models either entirely excluded social science concepts or included only a few measurements using poor proxies, current models more accurately, and more comprehensively capture key social science concepts to better examine and predict project implementation success and long-term sustainability. Despite several studies published within the last 20 years noting the need for more empirical studies of social sustainability and improvement in incorporation of social criteria, progress has remained rather stagnant in several areas. To help move the field forward, we conduct a review of the current state of social science research in aviation biofuels with a focus on sustainability, site-selection, and public acceptance research, identifying key approaches, important developments, and research gaps and weaknesses of current approaches. While several review studies already exist, they tend to focus on a single area of biofuels such as public acceptance. By broadening our review to several areas, we are able to identify several common limitations across these areas that contribute to the continued underutilization of social science approaches in aviation biofuels. This includes the preference for practical and reliable indicators for social criteria that prioritize quantitative methods over other approaches. Based on these limitations, we make several recommendations to improve social science research in aviation biofuels, including ensuring that social scientists are key members of the research team, the adoption of a mixed-methods research designs that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches that better measure some criteria and local-level impacts, and adequate resources for social science research throughout biofuel development projects as these methods are often more time-consuming and costly to implement. We argue that implementing these recommendations in future aviation biofuel development projects will improve social science approaches utilized in aviation biofuels research and address a long acknowledged gap in the field."],

Results are presented for a subset of domestic US flights in 2012 as well as for long haul flights tracked by the European IAGOS atmospheric research program between 2010 and 2013. For a given lateral flight route, there exists an optimal combination of altitude and speed. Analysis of 217,000 flights in domestic US airspace has shown average potential savings of up to 1.96% for altitude optimization or 1.93% for speed optimization. International flights may be subject to different airline and/or air traffic management procedures and constraints. Examination of 3,478 long-haul flights, representing three airlines and a single aircraft type over a four-year period, indicates average potential savings of up to 0.87% for altitude optimization or 1.81% for speed optimization. This is equivalent to a mean fuel savings of 905 pounds and 1981 pounds per flight, respectively. Due to the limited sample set for long haul flight records, conclusions from this stage of the international study are limited to the specific airlines and aircraft types included in the IAGOS measurement program."],

          "This paper examines the potential fuel efficiency benefits of cruise altitude and speed optimization using historical fight path records. Results are presented for a subset of domestic US flights in 2012 as well as for long haul flights tracked by the European IAGOS atmospheric research program between 2010 and 2013. For a given lateral flight route, there exists an optimal combination of altitude and speed. Analysis of 217,000 flights in domestic US airspace has shown average potential savings of up to 1.96% for altitude optimization or 1.93% for speed optimization. International flights may be subject to different airline and/or air traffic management procedures and constraints. Examination of 3,478 long-haul flights, representing three airlines and a single aircraft type over a four-year period, indicates average potential savings of up to 0.87% for altitude optimization or 1.81% for speed optimization. This is equivalent to a mean fuel savings of 905 pounds and 1981 pounds per flight, respectively. Due to the limited sample set for long haul flight records, conclusions from this stage of the international study are limited to the specific airlines and aircraft types included in the IAGOS measurement program.",

Pennycress can be adopted as a winter cover crop to make extra profit in addition to summer cash crops. This study ascertains influences on row crop farmers’ interest in growing pennycress to supply a biofuels industry. The study uses data from a survey of row-crop farmers in seven US states. Effects of farm and farmer attributes on acceptance of a farmgate pennycress price are measured. Nearly 58% were interested in growing pennycress if profitable. Among those interested, 54.4% would accept the farmgate pennycress price offered. Positive influences on interest included farm size, education, and familiarity with pennycress, while concern about knowledge on growing pennycress, and use of no-till practices had negative influences. Farmers aged 40 to 65 were more likely to accept the price, while share of rented hectares and no debt had positive influences. More risk-averse farmers and those using no-till were less likely to accept. Results suggest that the majority of row crop farmers would be interested in growing pennycress if profitable, while the overall willingness to accept the farmgate price was when it was at $0.28/kg."],

This separation of variables is associated with a fundamentally different inner product space for which PPOD is optimal and targets correlations in s, t space. This paper presents mathematical features of PPOD, followed by analysis of three experimental datasets from high-Reynolds-number, turbulent shear flows: a wake, a swirling annular jet and a jet in cross-flow. In the wake and swirling jet cases, the leading PPOD and space-only POD modes focus on similar features but differ in convergence rates and fidelity in capturing spatial and temporal information. In contrast, the leading PPOD and space-only POD modes for the jet in cross-flow capture completely different features – advecting shear layer structures and flapping of the jet column, respectively. This example demonstrates how the different inner product spaces, which order the PPOD and space-only POD modes according to different measures of variance, provide unique ‘lenses’ into features of advection-dominated flows, allowing complementary insights"],

Aviation fuel property and performance data has been gathered for many years in public and company specific fuel surveys. These surveys are suitable for use as overall quality control information and for monitoring changes and trends in the fuels in used for flight. In recent years, significant data has been generated for alternative fuels as part of the due diligence of their approval for use through ASTM D4054, including those outside of the specification. Recently, this data, along with fundamental chemistry data has led to the creation of the Fast Track route for fuels approval when the fuel is constrained to a necessarily narrowly defined composition. The data behind these developments are often stored in a disparate, unindexed way, resulting in their underutilisation for a range of research, engineering design, specification, and in service quality control applications. To make the best use of this data, we present a scalable, Json based format for the storing of fuels data. This concept has been proposed by the Horizon 2020 Jet Fuel SCREENing and Optimization (JETSCREEN) project in conjunction with the Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels and Environment (ASCENT) programme. We have worked collaboratively to develop a joint database which currently contains data from around 30,000 conventional and 400 alternative fuels/fuel blends from a range of European and United States of America (U.S.) lead research programmes and data sources.

These models seek to reflect the multitude of factors and conditions necessary for supply chain success. Social factors impacting that success have received increasingly greater attention but are often excluded due to difficulties in obtaining accurate and standard measures. Some of the most promising work in this arena utilizes a “community capitals approach” to create statistically grounded decision support tools (DSTs) intended to provide rapid assessment of the social characteristics of potential facility locations. Despite the value of the community capitals approach, this methodology is still marked by inconsistent predictivity due to an inability to reliably assess the cultural and historical nuances of local communities that are so vitally important to the long-term viability of these costly projects. This paper more fully examines the Community Assets and Attributes Model (CAAM) that has been developed and applied in the Pacific Northwest to incorporate social assets in site selection modeling. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Colorado and Wyoming dealing with biomass/bioenergy facility siting, we argue that cultural capital, a key component of the CAAM, is biased to urban locations due to the measurements incorporated. As a result of this bias, current site selection modeling based on the Community Capitals Framework (CCF) does not accurately reflect rural community assets. We assert that the CAAM does not actually measure cultural capital but a product of cultural capital, namely creativity, and innovation Our mixed methods approach that combines quantitative assessment with ethnographic research highlights the limits of the CAAM by revealing that local residents in largely rural counties showed willingness to innovate in some cases but in others referred to history with similar industries that may limit support. The quantitative cultural capital measurements of the CAAM for the four counties we examine, which range in scores from −0.53 to 2, do not capture these dynamics. These scores would generally suggest moderate to high levels of support for biomass/bioenergy facilities, but the ethnographic research provides nuance for or against support that are not reflected in the quantitative capital scores. This suggests that the quantitative CAAM scores could be misleading without added qualitative context. This work demonstrates that a mixed methods approach, combining ethnographic and historical methodologies with existing quantitative community capital approaches, will produce a more effective predictive methodology for facility siting due to its heightened ability to gather critical data on place-based values, beliefs, and historical legacies relating to natural resource development in general, and the timber industry specifically."],

Assessments of supersonic aircraft emissions impacts over the last decade have focused on the ozone and climate impacts of nitrogen oxides and water vapor, but assumed zero-sulfur fuel, zero black carbon emissions, and neglect likely design constraints on near-future engine technology. We assess the impacts on atmospheric composition and non-CO2 climate forcing of a near-future supersonic aircraft fleet with current-generation engine technology burning fossil-based kerosene fuel with current-day sulfur content. Using vehicle performance modeling, market demand projection and global atmospheric chemistry-transport modeling, we find that a supersonic fleet flying at Mach 1.6 and 15–17 km altitude, burning 19 Tg of fuel each year and emitting 170 Gg of NOx would cause a 0.046% reduction in global column ozone. We estimate the radiative forcing (climate impact) from changes in atmospheric concentrations of ozone (2.9 mW m-2), water vapor (1.3 mW m-2), carbonaceous and inorganic aerosols (-6.6 mW m-2), and methane (-0.65 mW m-2), resulting in a net non-CO2, non-contrail forcing of -3.5 mW m-2 and varying from -3.0 to -3.9 mW per m2 per year to year. We also show that the use of zero-sulfur fuel would halve net ozone depletion but increases the net non-CO2 non-contrail forcing to +2.8 mW m-2 due to the loss of a cooling effect from sulfate aerosols. A smaller fleet of Mach 2.2 aircraft flying at 18–20 km and burning 14 Tg of fuel but emitting twice as much NOx per unit of fuel results in 17 times as much net ozone depletion. The net radiative forcing for this fleet is of uncertain sign, averaging -0.15 mW m-2 but varying between -3.2 and +2.0 mW per m2 per year to year. Our results show that assessments of near-future supersonic aviation must consider the effects of fuel sulfur and black carbon alongside emissions of water vapor, NOx, and CO2, and that the net environmental impacts will be a trade-off between competing environmental concerns."],

This sampling system can be up to 35m in length. The sampling system length in addition to the volatile particle remover (VPR) and other sampling system components lead to substantial particle losses, which are a function of the particle size distribution, ranging from 50 to 90% for particle number concentrations and 10-50% for particle mass concentrations. The particle size distribution is dependent on engine technology, operating point, and fuel composition. Any nvPM emissions measurement bias caused by the sampling system will lead to unrepresentative emissions measurements which limit the method as a universal metric. Hence, a method to estimate size dependent sampling system losses using the system parameters and the measured mass and number concentrations was also developed (SAE 2017; SAE 2019). An assessment of the particle losses in two principal components used in ARP6481 (SAE 2019) was conducted during the VAriable Response In Aircraft nvPM Testing (VARIAnT) 2 campaign. Measurements were made on the 25-meter sample line portion of the system using multiple, well characterized particle sizing instruments to obtain the penetration efficiencies. An agreement of +/-15% was obtained between the measured and the ARP6481 method penetrations for the 25-meter sample line portion of the system. Measurements of VPR penetration efficiency were also made to verify its performance for aviation nvPM number. The research also demonstrated the difficulty of making system loss measurements and substantiates the E-31 decision to predict rather than measure system losses."],

          "A sampling system for measuring emissions of nonvolatile particulate matter (nvPM) from aircraft gas turbine engines has been developed to replace the use of smoke number and is used for international regulatory purposes. This sampling system can be up to 35m in length. The sampling system length in addition to the volatile particle remover (VPR) and other sampling system components lead to substantial particle losses, which are a function of the particle size distribution, ranging from 50 to 90% for particle number concentrations and 10-50% for particle mass concentrations. The particle size distribution is dependent on engine technology, operating point, and fuel composition. Any nvPM emissions measurement bias caused by the sampling system will lead to unrepresentative emissions measurements which limit the method as a universal metric. Hence, a method to estimate size dependent sampling system losses using the system parameters and the measured mass and number concentrations was also developed (SAE 2017; SAE 2019). An assessment of the particle losses in two principal components used in ARP6481 (SAE 2019) was conducted during the VAriable Response In Aircraft nvPM Testing (VARIAnT) 2 campaign. Measurements were made on the 25-meter sample line portion of the system using multiple, well characterized particle sizing instruments to obtain the penetration efficiencies. An agreement of +/-15% was obtained between the measured and the ARP6481 method penetrations for the 25-meter sample line portion of the system. Measurements of VPR penetration efficiency were also made to verify its performance for aviation nvPM number. The research also demonstrated the difficulty of making system loss measurements and substantiates the E-31 decision to predict rather than measure system losses."],

However, to date, the SAF price has, in part, been responsible for the lack of widespread adoption signaling the need for strong and stable policy. Multiple pathways have been developed and received ASTM approval to convert a variety of feedstocks into SAF, each with strengths and weaknesses that vary with conversion technology, feedstock, and production location. To assist researchers and governments in understanding the role of policy on fuel pricing, a set of harmonized, techno-economic analyses (TEAs) were developed to assess three ASTM-qualified production pathways: hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFAs), alcohol to jet (ATJ), and Fischer–Tropsch (FT), with multiple feedstock options. These decision support tools were used to assess the minimum selling price (MSP) for fuel distillates. Both mature (nth) plants and first of a kind (pioneer plants) were assessed using TEAs. Existing and proposed U.S. incentives, at both the federal and state levels, were integrated into the tools to determine the impact on the MSP. Considering the existing federal policies, analysis indicated that HEFAs could achieve a SAF price that would be competitive to conventional fuels when using waste lipid feedstocks, making this the most viable nearterm option. However, this feedstock for HEFAs is limited and unlikely to support the production of large quantities of SAF.

          "With jet fuel consumption projected to more than double by 2050, dramatic expansion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use will be essential to meeting the aviation industry goal of achieving carbon neutrality in the same time frame. However, to date, the SAF price has, in part, been responsible for the lack of widespread adoption signaling the need for strong and stable policy. Multiple pathways have been developed and received ASTM approval to convert a variety of feedstocks into SAF, each with strengths and weaknesses that vary with conversion technology, feedstock, and production location. To assist researchers and governments in understanding the role of policy on fuel pricing, a set of harmonized, techno-economic analyses (TEAs) were developed to assess three ASTM-qualified production pathways: hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFAs), alcohol to jet (ATJ), and Fischer–Tropsch (FT), with multiple feedstock options. These decision support tools were used to assess the minimum selling price (MSP) for fuel distillates. Both mature (nth) plants and first of a kind (pioneer plants) were assessed using TEAs. Existing and proposed U.S. incentives, at both the federal and state levels, were integrated into the tools to determine the impact on the MSP. Considering the existing federal policies, analysis indicated that HEFAs could achieve a SAF price that would be competitive to conventional fuels when using waste lipid feedstocks, making this the most viable nearterm option. However, this feedstock for HEFAs is limited and unlikely to support the production of large quantities of SAF. After stacking federal and state programs, SAF produced using FT with municipal solid waste (MSW) has the lowest MSP, although FT forest residuals, FT agricultural residues, ATJ corn ethanol, and HEFAs using second crop oilseeds all approach the historical range of traditional jet fuel prices for nth plants. Pioneer plants are viable for only ATJ corn ethanol; however, FT-MSW is approaching price parity."],

In this study, we examined NRS waypoint human factors issues that exist with regard to their nomenclature or use since their deployment approximately five years ago. The focus of this study has been predominantly on the human factors issues of NRS Waypoints for flight deck operators, although some information about issues that exist for air traffic controllers also have been collected and analyzed. We found that pilots and controllers tend to think of NRS waypoints in the same ways in which they think of traditionally named waypoints when seeing them on a flight plan and pilots do not believe they contribute to any particular CRM issues on the flight deck or require any changes to pilot flying and pilot monitoring roles and responsibilities. Dispatchers, in particular, agreed that NRS waypoints provide greater flexibility in route planning, especially in the western portion of the US where fewer ground based navigation aids exist. The pilots we interviewed indicated that they restrict their usage of NRS waypoints to original flight planning only (i.e., a strategic use). They reported that when using them tactically while enroute, such as for a diversion around weather, their workload could become quite high. Another problem we learned about is that many flight management system (FMS) databases lack the storage capacity to hold all 1600 NRS waypoints in addition to all the other RNAV and named waypoints in the NAS. This creates a need for the flight crew to program waypoint locations using lat/long entries, which is time consuming, difficult, and prone to data entry errors. Controllers we interviewed mentioned that NRS waypoints cannot be displayed on their radar scopes and so visualizing a flight route that includes NRS waypoints is more challenging.

          "NRS waypoints have been identified as essential features of RNAV Wind Routes and ATC Playbooks (Flow Evaluation Team, 2009) and the NextGen Air Traffic Management System more generally (Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics [RTCA], 2009). In this study, we examined NRS waypoint human factors issues that exist with regard to their nomenclature or use since their deployment approximately five years ago. The focus of this study has been predominantly on the human factors issues of NRS Waypoints for flight deck operators, although some information about issues that exist for air traffic controllers also have been collected and analyzed. We found that pilots and controllers tend to think of NRS waypoints in the same ways in which they think of traditionally named waypoints when seeing them on a flight plan and pilots do not believe they contribute to any particular CRM issues on the flight deck or require any changes to pilot flying and pilot monitoring roles and responsibilities.

        "mods.abstract":["The international aviation industry has the goal to gradually reduce carbon emissions mainly by using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). However, currently SAF cannot be produced at competitive prices relative to petroleum-based jet fuel. Pennycress is a crop whose oilseed could be used as a relatively low-cost feedstock to produce SAF, potentially benefiting farmers and the environment. This stochastic techno-economic analysis (TEA) studies an enterprise buying pennycress oilseed from farmers, extracting the bio-oil and selling it to a biorefinery that converts bio-oil into SAF. Maximum buying prices (MBP)—prices that yield a zero net present value—the crushing enterprise could pay farmers for pennycress oilseed are estimated. To conduct the analysis, discount rates are estimated based on financial data of biofuel firms, thus providing a realistic benchmark to evaluate profitability and feedstock buying prices. Estimated risk-adjusted discount rates vary between 12 and 17%, above rates typically used in similar valuations.

          "The international aviation industry has the goal to gradually reduce carbon emissions mainly by using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). However, currently SAF cannot be produced at competitive prices relative to petroleum-based jet fuel. Pennycress is a crop whose oilseed could be used as a relatively low-cost feedstock to produce SAF, potentially benefiting farmers and the environment. This stochastic techno-economic analysis (TEA) studies an enterprise buying pennycress oilseed from farmers, extracting the bio-oil and selling it to a biorefinery that converts bio-oil into SAF. Maximum buying prices (MBP)—prices that yield a zero net present value—the crushing enterprise could pay farmers for pennycress oilseed are estimated. To conduct the analysis, discount rates are estimated based on financial data of biofuel firms, thus providing a realistic benchmark to evaluate profitability and feedstock buying prices. Estimated risk-adjusted discount rates vary between 12 and 17%, above rates typically used in similar valuations. Estimated stochastic MBP range between 10.18 and 11.73 cent pound−1, which is below the price at which farmers are willing to plant pennycress, according to recent research. By considering the crushing facility’s inherent cash flow structure and risk, the distributions of stochastic modified internal rate of return suggest the crushing enterprise could be economically attractive at a 14% discount rate, our most likely estimate. However, between 11 and 17% times the cash flow model is simulated, the firm falls under financial distress. Overall, the findings suggest potential barriers for deployment of a SAF supply chain without governmental incentives or related policies."],

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a perennial bunchgrass native to North America with traits suitable for biofuel and co-product production. Previous chemical analysis has shown that ash content in switchgrass is related to the amount of nitrogen applied to the field, while at the biorefinery level, the percentage ash content reduces the biorefinery fuel output. To obtain optimal nitrogen (N) application rates for the switchgrass producers and the biorefinery, a two-part analysis is employed. First, a partial budgeting profitability analysis is conducted for this cropping enterprise at the farm-gate level without considering downstream implications of biomass quality, i.e., ash content. Second, the effects of higher ash content as a percentage of the feedstock on biorefinery output are analyzed. Results show farm-gate profit is maximized when N fertilizer is applied at 111 kg/ha, while as a result of increased production levels and decreased percentage ash content, biorefinery profit is maximized when N is applied at 157 kg/ha. Lower ash could lead to premium prices paid to switchgrass producers if higher quality feedstock were to be demanded as part of an integrated biofuel industry."],

          "Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) have different compositions compared to conventional petroleum jet fuels, particularly in terms of fuel sulfur and hydrocarbon content. These differences may change the amount and physicochemical properties of volatile and non-volatile particulate matter (nvPM) emitted by aircraft engines. In this study, we evaluate whether comparable nvPM measurement techniques respond similarly to nvPM produced by three blends of SAFs compared to three conventional fuels. Multiple SAF blends and conventional (Jet A-1) jet fuels were combusted in a V2527-A5 engine, while an additional conventional fuel (JP-8) was combusted in a CFM56-2C1 engine."],

It is motivated by the fact that, while reasonable correlations exist for predicting blow off conditions, the fundamental reasons for why flames supported by flow recirculation actually blow off are not well understood. Prior work on gaseous systems has shown that the blow off event is a culmination of several intermediate processes, initiating with local extinction of reactions (“stage 1”), followed by large scale changes in flame and flow dynamics (“stage 2”), finally leading to blow off. In this study, near-LBO dynamics were characterized for ten liquid fuels with widely varying kinetic and physical properties. Results were compared at two air inlet temperatures, 450 and 300 K, as this influences the relative importance of physical and kinetic properties in controlling LBO. Extinction, re-ignition, and recovery of the flame are evident from these data, and grow in frequency as blow off is approached. Results show that after a near-blow off event, the flame can move upstream at velocities much faster than the flow velocity, corresponding to re-ignition. Nonetheless, the majority of the flame recovery events appear to be associated with convection of hot products back upstream, not re-ignition. In contrast, downstream motion of the flame faster than the flow, which would correspond to bulk flame extinction, was never observed. This indicates that “extinction events” actually correspond to convection of the flame downstream by the flow when it loses its stabilization point. The dependence of the equivalence ratio when these events appear, their frequency, and event duration were quantified as a function of fuel composition and air inlet temperature. For example, the data shows a higher percentage of recovery from near-blow off events through re-ignition for high DCN fuels at the 450 K air temperature condition. These extinction/re-ignition results suggest that high DCN fuels are harder to blow off than low DCN fuels through two mechanisms: (1) by delaying the onset of LBO precursor events, and (2) because they are able to recover from these precursor events through re-ignition more often."],

However, producing biomass-based SAFs may induce changes in global land use and the associated carbon stock. The induced land use change (ILUC) emissions, as a part of the full life-cycle emissions for SAF pathways, will affect whether and to what extent SAFs reduce emissions compared with petroleum-based jet fuels. Here, we estimate the ILUC emission intensity for seventeen SAF pathways considered by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), covering five ASTM-certified technologies, nine biomass-based feedstocks, and four geographical regions. We introduce the SAF pathways into a well-established computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, GTAP-BIO, and its coupled emission accounting model, AEZ-EF, to study economy-wide implications of SAF production and estimate ILUC emissions intensity for each pathway. The estimated SAF ILUC emission intensities, using a 25-year amortization period, range from −58.5 g CO2e MJ−1 for the USA miscanthus alcohol (isobutanol)-to-jet (ATJ) pathway to 34.6 g CO2e MJ−1 for the Malaysia & Indonesia palm oil Hydrotreated Esters of Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway. Notably, the vegetable oil pathways tend to have higher ILUC emission intensities due to their linkage to palm expansion and peatland oxidation in Southeast Asia. The cellulosic pathways studied provide negative ILUC emissions, mainly driven by the high carbon sequestrations in crop biomass and soil. Using the core life-cycle emissions established by ICAO, we show that fifteen of the assessed pathways have a lower full life-cycle emission intensity than petroleum-based jet fuels (89 g CO2e MJ−1), offering promising options to reduce aviation emissions."],

          "Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are expected to play an essential role in achieving the aviation industries' goal of carbon-neutral growth. However, producing biomass-based SAFs may induce changes in global land use and the associated carbon stock. The induced land use change (ILUC) emissions, as a part of the full life-cycle emissions for SAF pathways, will affect whether and to what extent SAFs reduce emissions compared with petroleum-based jet fuels. Here, we estimate the ILUC emission intensity for seventeen SAF pathways considered by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), covering five ASTM-certified technologies, nine biomass-based feedstocks, and four geographical regions. We introduce the SAF pathways into a well-established computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, GTAP-BIO, and its coupled emission accounting model, AEZ-EF, to study economy-wide implications of SAF production and estimate ILUC emissions intensity for each pathway. The estimated SAF ILUC emission intensities, using a 25-year amortization period, range from −58.5 g CO2e MJ−1 for the USA miscanthus alcohol (isobutanol)-to-jet (ATJ) pathway to 34.6 g CO2e MJ−1 for the Malaysia & Indonesia palm oil Hydrotreated Esters of Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway. Notably, the vegetable oil pathways tend to have higher ILUC emission intensities due to their linkage to palm expansion and peatland oxidation in Southeast Asia. The cellulosic pathways studied provide negative ILUC emissions, mainly driven by the high carbon sequestrations in crop biomass and soil. Using the core life-cycle emissions established by ICAO, we show that fifteen of the assessed pathways have a lower full life-cycle emission intensity than petroleum-based jet fuels (89 g CO2e MJ−1), offering promising options to reduce aviation emissions.",

Sensitivity coefficients help to determine distinct chemical regimes, NOₓ-limited versus NOₓ-inhibited for the case of O₃ formation, and NH₃-rich versus NH₃-poor for the case of PM₂.₅ formation. Overall, the authors find that NOₓ LTO emissions are the largest contributor to any potential nonlinearity in O₃ and PM₂.₅ formation through LTO emissions. However, when utilizing Taylor series expansions to estimate O₃ and PM₂.₅ concentration responses under LTO emission perturbation scenarios, differences in responses calculated using only first order coefficients and responses calculated using both first and second order coefficients were less than 1% for LTO emission perturbations less than 100%. Hence, the authors find from the results in this study that first order sensitivity coefficients are sufficient for constructing accurate LTO emissions perturbation scenarios.

The Honeywell team hypothesized that each method would yield unique advantages and disadvantages. To investigate the limitations and capabilities of loadable versus manual entry of uplink clearances, we investigated a mix of Air Traffic Control (ATC) messages. The message set included a mix of single uplink messages, concatenated, and conditional messages in different categories including: altitude, speed, route, required time of arrival (RTA), and ATC reports. The study team observed and recorded flight crew-system behavior in the areas of automation surprises, pilot transaction times with data link, flight crew error and error recovery, flight crew coordination using the GOLD flight crew procedures, workload, and flight crew comments. FINDINGS: Mean flight crew response time: The mean response time for all ATC uplinks was 36.7 seconds across all conditions (without outliers). When outliers were included in the analysis, the mean response times was 44.5 seconds. 83% of the responses were under one minute, while 100% percent of the response times were under two minutes. These times are comparable to response times reported in other studies.

Despite the introduction of quieter aircraft, increased precision of onboard guidance systems has resulted in new noise impacts driven by overflight frequency effects. Noise issues present a potential barrier to the continued rollout of advanced operational procedures in the US. This thesis presents a data-driven approach to simulating and communicating noise effects in the flight procedure development and modernization process, with input from multiple stakeholders with varying objectives that are technical, operational, and political in nature. First, a system-level framework is introduced for developing novel noise-reducing arrival and departure flight procedures, clarifying the role of the analyst given diverse stakeholder objectives. The framework includes relationships between baseline impact assessment, community negotiation, iterative flight procedure development, and formal implementation processes. Variability in stakeholder objectives suggests a need to incorporate noise issues in conjunction with other key operational objectives as part of larger-scale US air transportation system modernization. As part of this framework development, an airport-level noise modeling method is developed to enable rapid exposure and impact analysis for system-level evaluation of advanced operational procedures. The modeling method and framework are demonstrated by evaluating potential benefits of specific advanced procedures at 35 major airports in the US National Airspace System, including Performance Based Navigation guidance and a speed-managed departure concept."],

Noise issues present a potential barrier to the continued rollout of advanced operational procedures in the US. This thesis presents a data-driven approach to simulating and communicating noise effects in the flight procedure development and modernization process, with input from multiple stakeholders with varying objectives that are technical, operational, and political in nature. First, a system-level framework is introduced for developing novel noise-reducing arrival and departure flight procedures, clarifying the role of the analyst given diverse stakeholder objectives. The framework includes relationships between baseline impact assessment, community negotiation, iterative flight procedure development, and formal implementation processes. Variability in stakeholder objectives suggests a need to incorporate noise issues in conjunction with other key operational objectives as part of larger-scale US air transportation system modernization. As part of this framework development, an airport-level noise modeling method is developed to enable rapid exposure and impact analysis for system-level evaluation of advanced operational procedures. The modeling method and framework are demonstrated by evaluating potential benefits of specific advanced procedures at 35 major airports in the US National Airspace System, including Performance Based Navigation guidance and a speed-managed departure concept.",

Exposure to PM2.5 from sources, including aviation, is associated with an increased risk of premature mortality, and BC suspended in the atmosphere has a warming impact on the climate. BC particles emitted from aircraft also serve as nuclei for contrail ice particles, which are a major component of aviation’s climate impact. To facilitate the evaluation of these impacts, we have developed a method to estimate BC mass and number emissions at the engine exit plane, referred to as the Smoke Correlation for Particle Emissions—CAEP11 (SCOPE11). We use a data set consisting of SN–BC mass concentration pairs, collected using certification-compliant measurement systems, to develop a new relationship between smoke number (SN) and BC mass concentration. In addition, we use a complementary data set to estimate measurement system loss correction factors and particle geometric mean diameters to estimate BC number emissions at the engine exit plane. Using this method, we estimate global BC emissions from aircraft landing and takeoff (LTO) operations for 2015 to be 0.74 Gg/year (95% CI = 0.64–0.84) and 2.85 × 1025 particles/year (95% CI = 1.86–4.49 × 1025)."],

In the case of conventional petroleum-derived fuels, the composition variation of the decomposition products is washed out due to the principle of large component number in real, multicomponent fuels. From a joint consideration of elemental conservation, thermodynamics and chemical kinetics, it is shown that the composition of the thermal decomposition products is a weak function of the thermodynamic condition, the fuel-oxidizer ratio and the fuel composition within the range of temperatures of relevance to flames and high temperature ignition. Based on these findings, we explore a hybrid chemistry (HyChem) approach to modeling the high-temperature oxidation of real, distillate fuels. In this approach, the kinetics of thermal and oxidative pyrolysis of the fuel is modeled using lumped kinetic parameters derived from experiments, while the oxidation of the pyrolysis fragments is described by a detailed reaction model.

        "mods.abstract":["This paper describes implementation of simultaneous, high speed (5 kHz) stereo PIV, OH and fuel-PLIF in a pressurized, liquid fueled, swirl stabilized flame. The experiments were performed to characterize the flow field, qualitative heat release and fuel spray distributions, and flame dynamics. Acquiring high speed OH-PLIF in pressurized, liquid fuel systems is difficult due to the strong overlap of the fuel's absorption and emission spectra with the OH fluorescence spectrum. To overcome difficulties associated with the overlap, the OH and fuel fluorescence signals were partially separated by using two cameras with differing spectral filters and data acquisition timing. Upon data reduction, regions containing fuel, OH and a mixture of fuel and OH are identified. Instantaneous and time-averaged results are discussed showing the flow field, flame position and dynamics, and spray distribution from the fuel signal for two multi-component liquid fuels, at two inlet temperatures and three pressures. These results are used to infer several important observations on coupled flow and flame physics. Specifically, the flame is “M-shaped” at higher preheat temperature and higher fuel/air ratio, as opposed to no visible reaction on the inside of the annular fuel/air jet at low temperature and fuel/air ratio conditions. While such fundamentally different flame topologies in gaseous, premixed flames are well known, these results show that there are also different families of flame shapes and heat release distributions in spray flames. In addition, the flame position with respect to the flow is different for the liquid-fueled flame than for gaseous, premixed flames—in premixed flames with this geometry, the flame lies in the low velocity shear layer separating the reactants and the recirculating products. In contrast, the flame location is controlled by the spray location in this spray flame, as opposed to the shear layer. For example, reactions are observed near the nozzle outlet in the core of the high velocity annular jet, something which would not be observed in the premixed flame configuration. Also of interest is the near invariance of the key flow features—such as jet core trajectory or shear layer locations—to the operating condition changes for this study, even as the spray penetration and distribution, and flame position change appreciably."],

          "This paper describes implementation of simultaneous, high speed (5 kHz) stereo PIV, OH and fuel-PLIF in a pressurized, liquid fueled, swirl stabilized flame. The experiments were performed to characterize the flow field, qualitative heat release and fuel spray distributions, and flame dynamics. Acquiring high speed OH-PLIF in pressurized, liquid fuel systems is difficult due to the strong overlap of the fuel's absorption and emission spectra with the OH fluorescence spectrum. To overcome difficulties associated with the overlap, the OH and fuel fluorescence signals were partially separated by using two cameras with differing spectral filters and data acquisition timing. Upon data reduction, regions containing fuel, OH and a mixture of fuel and OH are identified. Instantaneous and time-averaged results are discussed showing the flow field, flame position and dynamics, and spray distribution from the fuel signal for two multi-component liquid fuels, at two inlet temperatures and three pressures. These results are used to infer several important observations on coupled flow and flame physics. Specifically, the flame is “M-shaped” at higher preheat temperature and higher fuel/air ratio, as opposed to no visible reaction on the inside of the annular fuel/air jet at low temperature and fuel/air ratio conditions. While such fundamentally different flame topologies in gaseous, premixed flames are well known, these results show that there are also different families of flame shapes and heat release distributions in spray flames. In addition, the flame position with respect to the flow is different for the liquid-fueled flame than for gaseous, premixed flames—in premixed flames with this geometry, the flame lies in the low velocity shear layer separating the reactants and the recirculating products. In contrast, the flame location is controlled by the spray location in this spray flame, as opposed to the shear layer. For example, reactions are observed near the nozzle outlet in the core of the high velocity annular jet, something which would not be observed in the premixed flame configuration. Also of interest is the near invariance of the key flow features—such as jet core trajectory or shear layer locations—to the operating condition changes for this study, even as the spray penetration and distribution, and flame position change appreciably.",

        "mods.abstract":["The implementation of Performance Based Navigation (PBN) routes across the National Airspace System (NAS) has caused a significant concentration of flight tracks. This flight track concentration also creates a concentration of noise impacts on the communities surrounding airports, which has led to an increase in noise complaints at many airports that have implemented these routes. In order to understand these changes in noise, and to design procedures that could help mitigate any negative effects, it is important to have modeling tools capable of capturing the noise impacts of flight track variability. This thesis develops a model for this purpose. First, twenty days of radar flight trajectory data from 2015 and 2016 at Boston Logan International Airport (KBOS) is used to quantify the observed distributions of variability in speed, altitude, and lateral track position. It is shown that altitude and speed variability have relatively small impacts on noise, but that the impacts of observed lateral variability are significant. Using this information, a physics-based model is developed to capture the noise impacts of lateral flight track variability. This tool is then used to model several example scenarios. First, the changes in noise due to pre- and post-PBN procedures are examined for KBOS Runway 33L departures. Next, a hypothetical procedure is designed to intentionally introduce lateral dispersion to KBOS Runway 33L departures. Finally, the tool is used to rapidly model noise impacts on due to both arrival and departure operations on all runways at KBOS. The model is shown to reduce computational expense by 1-2 order of magnitude relative to traditional methods. The results of these example analyses show that increased lateral dispersion causes a significant noise reduction at higher noise levels directly below the flight track at the cost of wider contours at lower noise levels. Because of this, any decision to add or remove flight track lateral dispersion has highly localized impacts that depend on the geometry of the route and the population of the surrounding area, and thus must be closely analyzed on an individual basis."],

These procedures have proven effective for reducing fuel consumption and streamlining some aspects of air traffic control. However, flight tracks that were previously dispersed over wide areas due to less precise navigation or ATC vectoring are more concentrated on specific published tracks with effects on underlying communities. This study is an initial investigation to identify potential modifications to approach and departure procedures at Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) which would reduce community noise impact in areas which experience flight track concentration. Potential procedure modifications were separated into two sequential “Blocks”. Block 1 procedures were characterized by clear predicted noise benefits, limited operational/technical barriers and a lack of equity issues. Block 2 procedures exhibit greater complexity due to potential operational and technical barriers as well as equity issues (defined as noise redistribution between communities for the purposes of this study). This report presents recommendations for an initial set of Block 1 procedures. Continued analysis and community outreach will inform the identification and development of Block 2 procedures. RNAV procedures were implemented at BOS between 2012 and 2013. Candidate approach and departure modifications were first identified based on an analysis of historical flight track densities over the communities surrounding BOS before and after the implementation of new RNAV procedures coupled with noise complaint records and US Census population data. Potential procedure modifications were considered for each identified arrival and departure runway including: lateral flight track adjustment to avoid noise-sensitive areas, vertical trajectory modifications including speed, thrust or configuration management as well as techniques to reintroduce dispersion into flight trajectories. The technical recommendations presented in this report are not developed to an implementation-ready stage. Rather, the work completed to date represents a preliminary feasibility analysis for each recommended procedure. Prior to implementation of any of these recommendations, the FAA will need to execute internal verification and validation processes. Modifications to the recommended procedures may be required. The noise-reduction objectives for each procedure should be retained in any necessary procedure refinements. Procedure modification options were assigned to Block 1 or Block 2 based on a preliminary evaluation of noise reduction potential, operational/technical feasibility and potential equity issues. Some candidate procedures were rejected due to safety concerns or lack of noise benefits. The noise analysis compared the proposed modification with current procedures on a single-event basis. Noise contours and corresponding population exposures were calculated for the maximum noise level (LMAX) and Sound Exposure Level (SEL) metrics. The technical feasibility analysis included an examination of flight safety, aircraft performance, navigation and flight management system (FMS) limitations, pilot workload, ATC workload, and procedure design criteria. The process of procedure identification and refinement was informed by outreach to impacted stakeholders including community representatives, FAA regional and national offices, air traffic control (ATC) managers and specialists, airline technical pilots, and public officials."],

Pongamia pods are byproduct residues available after seed separation. Pods have high chlorine and potassium content that may be problematic in thermochemical energy conversion systems. Leaching experiments were performed to remove inorganic constituents of pods and thereby reduce the potential for fouling, slagging, and agglomeration. A 23 factorial design determined the impacts of process operating parameters (i.e. rinse water temperature (25 ◦C vs. 75 ◦C), rinse duration (10 min vs. 2 h), and particle size (<2 mm vs. whole pod)) on the composition and physicochemical properties of the pods and the water. The higher heating value of the pods was found to increase from 16 to 18–19 MJ/kg after leaching, while the ash content was reduced from 6.5% to as low as 2.8%wt, with significant removal of sulfur (S), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K). The chemical oxygen demand, non-purgeable organic carbon, and total nitrogen of the postexperiment leachates were all found to increase with the rinse water temperature and rinse duration but decrease with the increase of particle size. Leached pods were further processed via torrefaction and the targeted mass and energy yields, ~70% and 85%, respectively, were reached at a process temperature of 270 ◦C. The S, Cl, and K contents of the leached, torrefied pods were found to be lower than that of the raw pods. The reuse of leachate on successive batches of fresh pods showed that ash removal efficiency was reduced after three cycles, although some removal was possible through 15 cycles."],

          "Pongamia seedpods are recognized as a potential feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel production due to the relatively high oil content of the seeds. Pongamia pods are byproduct residues available after seed separation. Pods have high chlorine and potassium content that may be problematic in thermochemical energy conversion systems. Leaching experiments were performed to remove inorganic constituents of pods and thereby reduce the potential for fouling, slagging, and agglomeration. A 23 factorial design determined the impacts of process operating parameters (i.e. rinse water temperature (25 ◦C vs. 75 ◦C), rinse duration (10 min vs. 2 h), and particle size (<2 mm vs. whole pod)) on the composition and physicochemical properties of the pods and the water. The higher heating value of the pods was found to increase from 16 to 18–19 MJ/kg after leaching, while the ash content was reduced from 6.5% to as low as 2.8%wt, with significant removal of sulfur (S), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K). The chemical oxygen demand, non-purgeable organic carbon, and total nitrogen of the postexperiment leachates were all found to increase with the rinse water temperature and rinse duration but decrease with the increase of particle size. Leached pods were further processed via torrefaction and the targeted mass and energy yields, ~70% and 85%, respectively, were reached at a process temperature of 270 ◦C. The S, Cl, and K contents of the leached, torrefied pods were found to be lower than that of the raw pods. The reuse of leachate on successive batches of fresh pods showed that ash removal efficiency was reduced after three cycles, although some removal was possible through 15 cycles.",

Hypoxia is known to induce physiological and transcriptional changes that function together to permit normal cellular and tissue function at reduced oxygen (O2) levels. Short-term physiological responses include increased respiration and mild tachycardia; short-term transcriptional responses promote glycolysis and initiate angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and other mitigating adaptations. Hypoxia also induces changes in nuclear chromatin structure, altering histone methylation and chromatin accessibility profiles to promote or inhibit the transcription of specific genes. We assayed chromatin accessibility and gene expression in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) treated at 21%, 15% (the equivalent of aircraft cabin pressurization), and 2% O2 (typical of tissue hypoxia). Large-scale changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression were observed at 15% O2, including upregulation of histone genes and a reduction in intergenic and intronic chromatin accessibility. The 2% O2 treatment exhibited fewer changes in relation to the 21% O2 treatment and were mainly limited to the hypoxic response. ANGPTL4, an angiogenic regulator, increased at 2% O2 but decreased at 15% O2. Further, downregulation of the master regulator of the hypoxic response, HIF1α, was predicted at 15% O2 based on the expression status of the genes it regulates. In summary, HBECs exposed to 15% O2 for 16 hours exhibit a large-scale transcriptional and nucleosomal response that appears to exclude most hypoxia regulators and, instead, triggers a response possibly promoting altitude acclimatization."],

Most existing studies on supply chain resilience have primarily focused on assessing the system’s ability to withstand and recover from disruptions caused by a single type of hazard. However, a supply chain system is exposed to multiple exogenous and endogenous events and conditions over a planning horizon, and a comprehensive assessment of resilience should take into account multiple risk factors. Moreover, contrary to the conventional resilience assessment methods focusing on the short duration during which the system is impacted by a disaster event, the proposed framework measures the resilience capacities of the system over a long-term horizon through multi-risk assessment and multi-component resilience assessment. Specifically, a new multi-component resilience index is proposed to measure (a) hazard-induced cumulative loss of functionality, (b) opportunity-induced cumulative gain of functionality, and (c) non-hazard-induced cumulative loss of functionality. The case study results indicate that all three types of risk factors contribute to the overall resilience index significantly and ignoring any one of them may result in inaccurate supply chain performance and resilience assessment."],

          "The goal of this paper is to develop a quantitative resilience assessment framework for a supply chain system exposed to multiple risk factors. Most existing studies on supply chain resilience have primarily focused on assessing the system’s ability to withstand and recover from disruptions caused by a single type of hazard. However, a supply chain system is exposed to multiple exogenous and endogenous events and conditions over a planning horizon, and a comprehensive assessment of resilience should take into account multiple risk factors. Moreover, contrary to the conventional resilience assessment methods focusing on the short duration during which the system is impacted by a disaster event, the proposed framework measures the resilience capacities of the system over a long-term horizon through multi-risk assessment and multi-component resilience assessment. Specifically, a new multi-component resilience index is proposed to measure (a) hazard-induced cumulative loss of functionality, (b) opportunity-induced cumulative gain of functionality, and (c) non-hazard-induced cumulative loss of functionality. The case study results indicate that all three types of risk factors contribute to the overall resilience index significantly and ignoring any one of them may result in inaccurate supply chain performance and resilience assessment."],

        "mods.abstract":["Undisturbed and sufficiently long sleep is a prerequisite for a healthy life as well as for the prevention of fatigue-induced accidents. Especially the increasing air and freight rail traffic is more and more shifted to shoulder and night-time hours due to missing capacity and infrastructure during daytime. Thus, the sleep of residents near airports or railway tracks is increasingly affected by traffic noise. Only very few main airports, such as Frankfurt (Germany), implemented a night flight ban in order to countervail this trend. Since 1999 the Institute of Aerospace Medicine of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has investigated these night time noise effects in several field studies in which the sound pressure levels LAS and LAF and sound files were continuously measured with class one sound level meters at the sleeper’s ear. Sleep structure was recorded with polysomnography (simultaneous measurement of brain waves, eye movements, and muscle tone), the gold-standard to quantify sleep objectively. The results on sleep quality and additional awakening reactions due to traffic noise from former studies performed at Cologne/Bonn airport (high night time traffic) and a busy railway track in the Rhine valley (high night time freight traffic) are compared with the results of the recently completed NORAH (Noise-Related Annoyance, Cognition, and Health) study at Frankfurt airport. In the latter study data were collected both before as well as after the implementation of a ban of night flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.. Sound exposure distributions, average sound levels and sound level rise time distributions at the sleepers’ ear are presented for all three studies."],

          "Undisturbed and sufficiently long sleep is a prerequisite for a healthy life as well as for the prevention of fatigue-induced accidents. Especially the increasing air and freight rail traffic is more and more shifted to shoulder and night-time hours due to missing capacity and infrastructure during daytime. Thus, the sleep of residents near airports or railway tracks is increasingly affected by traffic noise. Only very few main airports, such as Frankfurt (Germany), implemented a night flight ban in order to countervail this trend. Since 1999 the Institute of Aerospace Medicine of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has investigated these night time noise effects in several field studies in which the sound pressure levels LAS and LAF and sound files were continuously measured with class one sound level meters at the sleeper’s ear. Sleep structure was recorded with polysomnography (simultaneous measurement of brain waves, eye movements, and muscle tone), the gold-standard to quantify sleep objectively. The results on sleep quality and additional awakening reactions due to traffic noise from former studies performed at Cologne/Bonn airport (high night time traffic) and a busy railway track in the Rhine valley (high night time freight traffic) are compared with the results of the recently completed NORAH (Noise-Related Annoyance, Cognition, and Health) study at Frankfurt airport. In the latter study data were collected both before as well as after the implementation of a ban of night flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.. Sound exposure distributions, average sound levels and sound level rise time distributions at the sleepers’ ear are presented for all three studies.",

Emissions from supersonic transports have raised crucial environmental concerns regarding ozone and climate. The atmospheric response is sensitive to a range of factors regarding aircraft types, designs, and deployment parameters. This study conducts a series of sensitivity experiments of possible future cruise altitudes to evaluate the potential atmospheric response for a fleet of supersonic aircraft assumed to be fully operational in 2050. Cruise emissions in the sensitivity studies were varied in 2 km bands over the 13–23 km altitude range. We show that the supersonic aircraft can induce both ozone increase and decrease depending on altitude primarily as a result of emissions of nitrogen oxides, and the changes in total column ozone depend on the cruise altitude. The total column ozone change is shown to have a small increase flying from 13 to 17 km, with the ozone impact not very dependent on cruise altitude. As cruise altitude transitions from 17 to 23 km, the ozone impact transitions from production to depletion and the column ozone depletion strongly depends on cruise altitude. We also explore the seasonal ozone loss, changes in ozone, and climate radiative forcing per unit of fuel burn as a function of cruise altitude. The climate impact of water vapor emissions shows a larger effect associated with higher cruise altitude, with more than 1 mW m−2 Tg−1 yr for cruise altitudes above 19 km."],

          "The possibility of commercial and business supersonic aircraft that fly in the lower stratosphere is being discussed and specific designs are under consideration. Emissions from supersonic transports have raised crucial environmental concerns regarding ozone and climate. The atmospheric response is sensitive to a range of factors regarding aircraft types, designs, and deployment parameters. This study conducts a series of sensitivity experiments of possible future cruise altitudes to evaluate the potential atmospheric response for a fleet of supersonic aircraft assumed to be fully operational in 2050. Cruise emissions in the sensitivity studies were varied in 2 km bands over the 13–23 km altitude range. We show that the supersonic aircraft can induce both ozone increase and decrease depending on altitude primarily as a result of emissions of nitrogen oxides, and the changes in total column ozone depend on the cruise altitude. The total column ozone change is shown to have a small increase flying from 13 to 17 km, with the ozone impact not very dependent on cruise altitude. As cruise altitude transitions from 17 to 23 km, the ozone impact transitions from production to depletion and the column ozone depletion strongly depends on cruise altitude. We also explore the seasonal ozone loss, changes in ozone, and climate radiative forcing per unit of fuel burn as a function of cruise altitude. The climate impact of water vapor emissions shows a larger effect associated with higher cruise altitude, with more than 1 mW m−2 Tg−1 yr for cruise altitudes above 19 km.",

A substantial number of complaints concerning airport noise come from locations outside the 65dB Day-Night Level (DNL) contour considered the significant noise exposure threshold in U.S. federal regulation. This indicates that this threshold does not sufficiently capture areas that experience annoyance related to more concentrated, lower level overflight noise at distances farther from the airport. This thesis assesses the effectiveness by which different noise analysis methods capture the locations of these airport noise complaints through examination of the noise exposure for three representative scenarios at Boston Logan International Airport using DNL and number of overflights above a noise threshold (Nabove) metrics. The three scenarios examined include the standard noise analysis methodology scenario (annual average day) as well as a day of heavy usage of a noise-sensitive runway (33L for departures), and a scenario representing a peak hour of departures on this runway. The results indicate that the 33L peak day scenario does a better job of capturing a substantial fraction of the complainants sensitive to the 33L departure trajectories (66%-87% at the 45dB-50dB DNL thresholds) than the standard annual average day scenario. Results for the 33L peak day scenario indicate that the Nabove metric is also effective at capturing noise complaints at the 60dB day/50dB night noise threshold at exposure rates in the 25-50 overflight range (78%-84% complainant capture)."],

Towards the high-temperature end of the distillation curve, some of the aromatics may contain multiple rings. A trace amount of these high molecular weight species in the fuel would directly allow for soot nucleation in practical engines especially when the fuel is injected as a spray. This work aims to highlight the variation of the sooting propensity as a function of distillate fractions. Evolution of soot particle size distribution functions (PSDFs) is studied in a series of premixed stretch-stabilized ethylene-oxygen-nitrogen flames doped with Jet A or a certain distillate fraction. Mobility particle size distributions functions, soot volume fraction, and number density are determined by a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS). The results show that the tail end of the distillation curve can produce significantly more soot than the light molecular fraction and the not distilled jet fuel. The implication of the experimental finding on modeling soot formation from real jet fuel combustion will be discussed."],

          "Real jet fuels are complex mixtures of many organic components, some of which are aromatic compounds. Towards the high-temperature end of the distillation curve, some of the aromatics may contain multiple rings. A trace amount of these high molecular weight species in the fuel would directly allow for soot nucleation in practical engines especially when the fuel is injected as a spray. This work aims to highlight the variation of the sooting propensity as a function of distillate fractions. Evolution of soot particle size distribution functions (PSDFs) is studied in a series of premixed stretch-stabilized ethylene-oxygen-nitrogen flames doped with Jet A or a certain distillate fraction. Mobility particle size distributions functions, soot volume fraction, and number density are determined by a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS). The results show that the tail end of the distillation curve can produce significantly more soot than the light molecular fraction and the not distilled jet fuel. The implication of the experimental finding on modeling soot formation from real jet fuel combustion will be discussed.",

        "mods.abstract":["Recent developments in navigation and surveillance technology have enabled new high-precision departure and arrival procedures using GPS and Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) standards. These procedures have proven effective for reducing fuel consumption and streamlining some aspects of air traffic control. However, flight tracks that were previously dispersed over wide areas due to less precise navigation or ATC vectoring are more concentrated on specific published tracks with effects on underlying communities. The objective of this study was to identify potential modifications to departure and arrival procedures at Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) which would reduce community noise impact in areas which experience flight track concentration. The potential procedure modifications were separated into two sequential “Blocks”. Block 1 procedures were characterized by clear predicted noise benefits, limited operational/technical barriers and a lack of equity issues. Block 2 procedures exhibit greater complexity due to potential operational and technical barriers as well as equity considerations (defined as noise redistribution between communities for the purposes of this study). The Block 2 phase included consideration of procedures which would redistribute noise exposure such as approaches to increase flight trajectory dispersion, which have been requested by some communities. It also included new noise reduction opportunities enabled by PBN that were identified during the Block 2 process, as well as a redesigned procedure which resolved technical issues identified with one of the prior Block 1 recommendations. Candidate approach and departure modifications were first identified based on an analysis of historical flight track densities over the communities surrounding BOS before and after the implementation of new RNAV procedures coupled with noise complaint records and US Census population data. Potential procedure modifications were considered for each identified arrival and departure runway as well as procedure concepts to reintroduce dispersion into flight trajectories. The noise impact of candidate procedure modifications was modeled and presented to community and operational stakeholder groups. Community feedback was used to identify procedures of interest and gather input on improvements or revisions. Operational stakeholder feedback was used to identify and to the extent possible mitigate operational barriers and concerns."],

These goals are to reduce significant community noise and air quality emissions impacts in absolute terms and limit the impact of aircraft CO₂ emissions on the global climate by achieving carbon neutral growth by 2020 compared to 2005, thereby allowing sustained aviation growth. The objectives of this project leverage the research conducted under the Environmental Design Space (EDS) development program (PARTNER Project 14) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), to use EDS to independently model and assess the benefits of the technologies being developed under the CLEEN Program. EDS has been jointly developed by NASA and FAA and has been used to assess a wide variety of both conventional and advanced technology configurations. The project focused on six primary elements: (1) public domain aircraft technology modeling (Phase I); (2) proprietary CLEEN aircraft technology modeling (Phase II); (3) vehicle level assessments of fuel burn, noise, and NOx incorporating these technologies; (4) fleet-level assessments of fuel burn and NOx using vehicles with these technologies; (5) development of an Excel-based technology dashboard for use at the FAA; and (6) examining historical trends in aircraft technology. The most significant outcome of this work was vehicle and fleet-level benefit assessments of the CLEEN aircraft technologies with regards to fuel burn, NOx emissions, and noise. Additionally, the Excel-based dashboard that was developed provides FAA with an in-house capability beyond the conclusion of this project to quickly assess combinations of these technologies and their benefits."],

          "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is pursuing the development of Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) technologies for civil subsonic jet airplanes to help achieve the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) goals. These goals are to reduce significant community noise and air quality emissions impacts in absolute terms and limit the impact of aircraft CO₂ emissions on the global climate by achieving carbon neutral growth by 2020 compared to 2005, thereby allowing sustained aviation growth. The objectives of this project leverage the research conducted under the Environmental Design Space (EDS) development program (PARTNER Project 14) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), to use EDS to independently model and assess the benefits of the technologies being developed under the CLEEN Program. EDS has been jointly developed by NASA and FAA and has been used to assess a wide variety of both conventional and advanced technology configurations. The project focused on six primary elements: (1) public domain aircraft technology modeling (Phase I); (2) proprietary CLEEN aircraft technology modeling (Phase II); (3) vehicle level assessments of fuel burn, noise, and NOx incorporating these technologies; (4) fleet-level assessments of fuel burn and NOx using vehicles with these technologies; (5) development of an Excel-based technology dashboard for use at the FAA; and (6) examining historical trends in aircraft technology. The most significant outcome of this work was vehicle and fleet-level benefit assessments of the CLEEN aircraft technologies with regards to fuel burn, NOx emissions, and noise. Additionally, the Excel-based dashboard that was developed provides FAA with an in-house capability beyond the conclusion of this project to quickly assess combinations of these technologies and their benefits."],

There are models that have been developed to predict the eﬀect of aircraft noise on sleep. However, most of these models only predict the percentage of the population that is awakened. Markov and nonlinear dynamic models have been developed to predict an individual’s sleep structure during the night. However, both of these models have limitations. The purpose of this research was to examine these sleep structure models to determine how they could be altered to predict the eﬀect of aircraft noise on sleep. Diﬀerent approaches for adding a noise level dependence to the Markov Model was explored and the modiﬁed model was validated by comparing predictions to behavioral awakening data. In order to determine how to add faster dynamics to the nonlinear dynamic sleep models it was necessary to have a more detailed sleep stage classiﬁcation than was available from visual scoring of sleep data. An automatic sleep stage classiﬁcation algorithm was developed which extracts diﬀerent features of polysomnography data including the occurrence of rapid eye movements (REMs), sleep spindles, and slow wave sleep. Using these features an approach for classifying sleep stages every one second during the night was developed. From observation of the results of the sleep stage classiﬁcation, it was determined how to add faster dynamics to the nonlinear dynamic model. Slow and fast REM activity are modeled separately and the activity in the gamma frequency band of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is used to model both spontaneous and noise-induced awakenings. The nonlinear model predicts changes in sleep structure similar to those found by other researchers and reported in the sleep literature and similar to those found in obtained survey data. To compare sleep disturbance model predictions, ﬂight operations data from United States airports were obtained and sleep disturbance in communities was predicted for diﬀerent operations scenarios using the modiﬁed Markov model, the nonlinear dynamic model, and other aircraft noise awakening models. Similarities and diﬀerences in model predictions were evaluated in order to determine if the use of the developed sleep structure model leads to improved predictions of the impact of nighttime noise on communities."],

There is concern that this metric with penalties for noise occurring at night does not adequately account for annoyance or broader noise impacts such as sleep disturbance. Much more sophisticated measures of perceived sound level (loudness) that adjust frequency weighting based on the characteristics of the sounds exist. Although loudness is considered to be the strongest noise attribute contributing to annoyance, there are other sound attributes, such as sharpness, tone, roughness and fluctuation strength that can also influence annoyance. In this research, several studies were conducted to examine the effects of noise characteristics on annoyance ratings of aircraft noise. A simulation program was developed to simulate aircraft noises so that individual characteristics could be varied while keeping others constant. Investigations on the influence of single characteristics such as spectral balance, roughness, fluctuation strength, and tone on annoyance ratings of aircraft noise have been conducted. Some evidence of an increase in annoyance with increases in roughness and tone was observed in these investigations. The influence of tone and roughness on annoyance ratings in the presence of loudness variations was also observed. Even when both loudness and tone varied, a strong sensitivity to tone persisted. Tone was the dominant sensation when both tone and roughness were varied and loudness was kept constant. The importance of tone and roughness increased when loudness did not vary very much. It was found that loudness, tone and roughness were, respectively, the first, second and third most influential characteristics. It was also seen that the use of loudness produces better predictions of average annoyance ratings. None of the metrics or models that are currently used for environmental noise annoyance incorporate measures of loudness, tone, and roughness together. In this research, a model based on the Psychoacoustic Annoyance developed by Zwicker, Fastl and others that combines the effects of loudness, tone and roughness to predict annoyance due to aircraft noise was developed. The developed model was found to be a better predictor of aircraft noise annoyance than any other metric or models that are currently used to evaluate aircraft noise."],

Investigations on the influence of single characteristics such as spectral balance, roughness, fluctuation strength, and tone on annoyance ratings of aircraft noise have been conducted. Some evidence of an increase in annoyance with increases in roughness and tone was observed in these investigations. The influence of tone and roughness on annoyance ratings in the presence of loudness variations was also observed. Even when both loudness and tone varied, a strong sensitivity to tone persisted. Tone was the dominant sensation when both tone and roughness were varied and loudness was kept constant. The importance of tone and roughness increased when loudness did not vary very much. It was found that loudness, tone and roughness were, respectively, the first, second and third most influential characteristics. It was also seen that the use of loudness produces better predictions of average annoyance ratings. None of the metrics or models that are currently used for environmental noise annoyance incorporate measures of loudness, tone, and roughness together. In this research, a model based on the Psychoacoustic Annoyance developed by Zwicker, Fastl and others that combines the effects of loudness, tone and roughness to predict annoyance due to aircraft noise was developed. The developed model was found to be a better predictor of aircraft noise annoyance than any other metric or models that are currently used to evaluate aircraft noise."],

This project linked national data on Medicare enrollees and noise contours surrounding each of 89 airports to evaluate the relationship between aviation-related noise and hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease. A variety of exposure metrics for noise were constructed and these metrics were linked with zip code-level data on air pollution exposures, population demographics, socioeconomic factors, and other individual-level and zip code-level covariates. Bayesian hierarchical models were constructed to estimate health risks associated with noise in the vicinity of each airport, capturing health impacts in aggregate and by location. These models were used to consider the health effects of aircraft noise exposure on hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease in total and for multiple specific endpoints. Despite limitations related to potential misclassification of exposure, there was a statistically significant association between exposure to aircraft noise and risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases among Medicare enrollees."],

          "Until recently, no major US study had estimated the association between long-term exposure to noise and cardiovascular outcomes while accounting for the potential confounding from air pollution and socioeconomic determinants of health. This project linked national data on Medicare enrollees and noise contours surrounding each of 89 airports to evaluate the relationship between aviation-related noise and hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease. A variety of exposure metrics for noise were constructed and these metrics were linked with zip code-level data on air pollution exposures, population demographics, socioeconomic factors, and other individual-level and zip code-level covariates. Bayesian hierarchical models were constructed to estimate health risks associated with noise in the vicinity of each airport, capturing health impacts in aggregate and by location. These models were used to consider the health effects of aircraft noise exposure on hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease in total and for multiple specific endpoints. Despite limitations related to potential misclassification of exposure, there was a statistically significant association between exposure to aircraft noise and risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases among Medicare enrollees."],

Advanced procedures such as delayed deceleration approaches, where aircraft maintain higher speeds and therefore remain cleanly configured and at lower thrust levels for longer flight periods, can be used for airport noise abatement. Delayed deceleration approaches have been shown in modeling to offer noise reductions before the stabilization point compared to procedures that decelerate early. The delayed deceleration approach validation methodology is demonstrated through monitoring of operational radar data with varying velocity profiles from Boeing 737, Airbus A320, and Embraer E190 flights and comparing modeled sound exposure levels of these procedures with available ground-noise-monitor data at two major airports. Thrust from radar flights was modeled based on weight predicted from final approach speed and assumed configuration. When corrected for atmospheric conditions, modeled noise is shown to be consistent with noisemonitor readings under reasonable flap-deployment schedule assumptions during observed early, intermediate, and delayed deceleration approaches. In addition, delayed deceleration approaches correlated with monitor readings with lower noise levels of an average of 3–6 dB compared to early deceleration approaches across different aircraft types."],

Federal consumption of fuels is dominated by the Department of Defense and the Air Force consumes more fuel than any of the other military services or federal agencies (Defense Science Board 2008). Thus, aviation applications may become early adopters of low carbon transportation fuels"],

The findings and observations included in this research are intended to provide insight into the potential implications of response scenarios on the NAS, and support the decision-making processes for mitigating the environmental impacts of aircraft operations within the NAS. In this research, two response scenarios were identified based on assumed potential responses from metric systems exhibiting transport capability neutrality (TCN) and non-TCN characteristics. The TCN metric system was assumed to be sensitive only to technology introduction, thus a technology response system (TRS), while the non-TCN metric system was assumed to be sensitive only to aircraft capability, and was thus a capability response system (CRS). This research found that the TRS had a greater benefit on the NAS in terms of fuel consumption, NOx emissions, noise contour area, and climate impacts than the CRS."],

The AJFTD, containing fuel sample records of conventional and sustainable aviation fuels to date, was developed by the PIs through the FAA Center of Excellence (ASCENT). With the development of SAF from various feedstocks and processing methods, new approval processes have been developed to accommodate the changing jet fuel landscape. To control for these differences, approval procedures were designed as each new fuel category came through the development pipeline. However, recent studies have suggested that rather than feedstock or processing method, chemical properties and fuel performance can be accurately judged by considering fuel composition characteristics such as carbon chain length, hydrocarbon class, and branching level. To quantify the variability present in recently approved jet fuels, this paper evaluates physicochemical property variability and provides relevant thermophysical property relations for conventional and alternative jet fuels with a discussion of efforts to streamline approval, reducing the time and cost of bringing new SAF to future markets. Findings from this study show that the variability in the composition and properties of SAF as compared to conventional fuels is small enough such that they still satisfy specification requirements outlined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D7566 standards for aviation fuels containing synthesized hydrocarbons."],

Proximate and ultimate analyses, heating value, and elemental composition of the seed, shell, and de-oiled seed cake were determined across five sampling locations in Hawaii. The aged and freshly harvested kukui seeds were found to have similar oil contents, ranging from 61 to 64%wt. Aged seeds, however, have 2 orders of magnitude greater free fatty acids than those freshly harvested (50% vs 0.4%). The nitrogen content of the de-oiled kukui seed cake was found to be comparable to that of the soybean cake. Aging of kukui seeds can decrease the flashpoint temperature and increase the liquid−solid phase transition temperatures of kukui oil obtained. Mg and Ca are the major ash-forming elements present in the kukui shells, >80%wt of all metal elements detected, which may reduce deposition problems for thermochemical conversion in comparison with hazelnut, walnut, and almond shells. The study also revealed that kukui oil has similar characteristics to canola, indicating that it is well-suited for biofuel production."],

          "Fuel properties of oil-bearing kukui (Aleurites moluccana) nuts, a commonly found crop in Hawaii and tropical Pacific regions, were comprehensively studied to evaluate their potential for bioenergy production. Proximate and ultimate analyses, heating value, and elemental composition of the seed, shell, and de-oiled seed cake were determined across five sampling locations in Hawaii. The aged and freshly harvested kukui seeds were found to have similar oil contents, ranging from 61 to 64%wt. Aged seeds, however, have 2 orders of magnitude greater free fatty acids than those freshly harvested (50% vs 0.4%). The nitrogen content of the de-oiled kukui seed cake was found to be comparable to that of the soybean cake. Aging of kukui seeds can decrease the flashpoint temperature and increase the liquid−solid phase transition temperatures of kukui oil obtained. Mg and Ca are the major ash-forming elements present in the kukui shells, >80%wt of all metal elements detected, which may reduce deposition problems for thermochemical conversion in comparison with hazelnut, walnut, and almond shells. The study also revealed that kukui oil has similar characteristics to canola, indicating that it is well-suited for biofuel production."],

It is hypothesized that the type of secondary sonic booms resulting from a primary boom surface reflection could be substantially affected by the topography. A primary boom impacting a flat ocean will provide for a coherent reflected wave. In contrast, a primary boom impacting typical surface topography of the land will produce a more diffuse reflection. Assuming additional propagation effects such as atmospheric absorption would be similar in the two cases, the difference between coherent or diffuse reflections might explain why secondary booms reflection over typical land surfaces would produce decreased sound levels and therefore be less problematic than for the same booms reflecting over a calm ocean surface."],

        "mods.abstract":["With rising concerns over commercial aviation’s contribution to global carbon emissions, the aviation industry faces tremendous pressure to adopt advanced solutions for reducing its share of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. One near-term potential solution to mitigate this global emissions situation is to operate existing aircraft with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF); this solution requires almost no modification to current aircraft, making it the “quickest” approach to reduce aviation carbon emissions, albeit the actual impact will be determined by the degree to which airlines adopt and use SAF, the ticket price impact of SAF, and the future growth of travel demand. This article presents results that estimate the expected fleet-wide emissions of future airline operations using SAF considering various projected traveler demand and biofuel penetration/utilization levels. The work demonstrates an approach to make these predictions by modeling the behavior of a profit-seeking airline using the Fleet-Level Environmental Evaluation Tool (FLEET). Considering five future SAF scenarios and two future passenger demand projection scenarios, FLEET estimates future fleet-level CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, showcasing the possible upper and lower bounds on future aviation emissions when SAF is introduced for use in airline fleets. Results show that the future fleet-level CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for all scenarios with SAF are lower than the baseline scenario with no SAF, for all demand projection scenarios. The passenger demand served and the trips flown for a given SAF scenario depends on the SAF price and the biofuel penetration levels. This shows that even if airlines serve a higher passenger demand for some future scenarios, the carbon emissions could still be lower than the current baseline scenario where airlines only use conventional jet fuel."],

Many studies have addressed uncertainties associated with these estimates. These studies have broadly examined uncertainties associated with the choice of economic models, their assumptions and parameters, and a few bio-physical variables. However, uncertainties in land-use emission factors that represent the soil and vegetation carbon contents of various land types across the world and are used to estimate carbon fluxes due to land conversions are mostly overlooked. This paper calls attention to this important omission. It highlights some important sources of uncertainty in land-use emissions factors, explores the range in these factors from established data sources, and compares the influence of their variability on ILUC emissions for several sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathways. The estimated land-use changes for each pathway are taken from a well-known computable general equilibrium model, GTAP-BIO. Two well-known carbon calculator models (CCLUB and AEZ-EF) that represent two different sets of emissions factors are used to convert the GTAP-BIO estimated land-use changes to ILUC emissions. The results show that the calculated ILUC emissions obtained from these carbon calculators for each examined SAF pathway are largely different, even for the same amortization time horizon. For example, the ILUC emissions values obtained from the AEZ-EF and CCLUB models for producing jet fuel from corn ethanol for a 25-year amortization period are 24.9 gCO2e/MJ and 15.96 gCO2e/MJ, respectively. This represents a 60% difference between the results of these two carbon calculators for the same set of land-use changes. The results show larger differences for other pathways as well."],

The need to generate chemical kinetic mechanisms rapidly with less uncertainty is a critical requirement to efficiently assess newly introduced sustainable aviation fuels. To overcome the under-constrained nature of the optimization process with readily available but limited data, a hybrid response surface technique was developed to rapidly repeat this fitting process and provide a distribution of solutions. Through this approach, not only can the uncertainties be quantified, but the distribution of solutions can also be used to identify additional data that can reduce those uncertainties. Since extensive experimental measurements can be costly, the ability to identify a limited set of additional data can be of great importance. In this study, we demonstrate this approach using a Jet-A chemical kinetic mechanism that was optimized towards new experimental ignition delay measurements using the hybrid response surface network approach. This mechanism is shown to produce well-constrained ignition delay predictions at conditions of other ignition delay data in the literature, but significant uncertainty in chemical species were observed when compared to shock tube pyrolysis species measurements. By constraining one key chemical species from the response surface analysis, it is shown that most of the uncertainty in the remaining species was also reduced and utilizing two species provided extremely strong constraints.

Principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the spectroscopic data from a highly olefinic fuel intermediate. A principal component template was created that enabled olefin quantitation, which was compared to the existing GCxGC-VUV approach from the literature. The principal component method was able to identify and quantify trace amounts of cyclodienes, which were present at only 0.01 wt% in the fuel sample. The principal component approach also identifies species that fall outside of the GCxGC template. For instance, quantitation with the literature method resulted in an olefin concentration of 0.95 times that of the principal component method due to olefins falling outside of the expected GCxGC regions. The principal component results were compared with 13C and 1H NMR data, which confirmed that the fuel had a high concentration of olefins and alkanes with little aromatic content."],

Modeling the environmental effects helps the aerospace community obtain quantitative data linked to aircraft emissions and noise. The Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) offers the capability to model aviation operations using data sources of differing fidelity and is used worldwide for quantifying emissions and noise impacts of such operations. As a result, validating the accuracy of AEDT is of vital importance for continuous sustainability efforts. This paper presents preliminary results of AEDT noise model validation at the San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The overall sensitivity of noise predictions to varying assumptions within AEDT is explored and quantified using a set of real-world flights modeled within it. This is achieved by utilizing routine Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) data records from airline operations, noise monitoring data from various stations around the SFO airport, and various weather data sources. The outcomes of this validation study are expected to benefit the developers of AEDT to produce a more accurate noise model."],

        "dc.description.abstract":["A focus on sustainability in aviation is required to mitigate the environmental impact of its growth. Modeling the environmental effects helps the aerospace community obtain quantitative data linked to aircraft emissions and noise. The Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) offers the capability to model aviation operations using data sources of differing fidelity and is used worldwide for quantifying emissions and noise impacts of such operations. As a result, validating the accuracy of AEDT is of vital importance for continuous sustainability efforts. This paper presents preliminary results of AEDT noise model validation at the San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The overall sensitivity of noise predictions to varying assumptions within AEDT is explored and quantified using a set of real-world flights modeled within it. This is achieved by utilizing routine Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) data records from airline operations, noise monitoring data from various stations around the SFO airport, and various weather data sources. The outcomes of this validation study are expected to benefit the developers of AEDT to produce a more accurate noise model."],

Sixty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with participant backgrounds ranging from captains, first officers, check pilots, training personnel and other individuals familiar with flight deck task management primarily in Part 121 or similar Part 135 operations. Participants worked for domestic U.S. operators, or European based operators. The study found several human factors contributing to task management deficiencies and vulnerabilities including interruptions, disruptions, distractions, communication, time management, pressure, task load, task saturation, task allocation, fatigue, stress, individual differences, international ATC, system complexity, and operational complexity. Six categories of mitigations were identified related to communication mitigations, policies and procedures, prioritization strategies, metacognitive strategies, strategic and tactical strategies for organizing tasks, and training. However, these mitigations do not fully address the impact of high workload and stress on task management. While participants perceived some mitigations to be effective, gaps remain in providing comprehensive task management strategies, especially for high workload conditions, and methods to effectively train task management. Next steps should include (1) explorations of training opportunities to strengthen current mitigations, including development of skills needed for effectively executing task management strategies, (2) exploration of potentially new mitigations for stress and fatigue, and (3) validating the relative importance and relationships of the factors identified in this work, as the factors identified did not occur in isolation but were interconnected and related to one another."],

The source separation process is based on combining a time-domain de-Dopplerization method with the Vold-Kalman (VK) order tracking filter approach. This process can extract rotor harmonic noise even when the sources are continuously changing with time, including impulsive events such as Blade Vortex Interaction (BVI) noise. The advantage of this approach over traditional methods such as harmonic averaging is that the phase and amplitude relationship of acoustic signals is preserved throughout the extraction process. The approach is applied to the measured acoustic data from a Bell 430 helicopter. The measured data were separated into main rotor harmonic, tail rotor harmonic, and broadband residual components. For steady-state conditions, the extracted components could be de-propagated to form acoustic spheres showing the directivity of the separated main and tail rotor components. The source separation process was also applied to a maneuvering flight condition. Each component has different pulse shapes and directivity trends, consistent with aeroacoustic theory."],

As noise certification standards for supersonic transport other than Concorde have not yet been developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization, there is a need for a physics-based scaling rule for supersonic transport takeoff noise performance. Assuming supersonic transport takeoff noise levels are dominated by the engine mixed jet velocity and the aircraft-to-microphone propagation distance, this paper presents a reduced order model for supersonic transport takeoff noise levels as a function of four scaling groups: cruise Mach number, takeoff aerodynamic efficiency, takeoff speed, and number of installed engines. This paper finds that, as cruise Mach number increases, supersonic transport takeoff noise levels increase while their thrust cutback noise reduction potential decreases. Assuming constant aerodynamic efficiency, takeoff speed, and number of installed engines, the takeoff noise levels, and noise reduction potential of a Mach 2.2 aircraft are found to be∼15.3 dB higher and∼19.2 dB less compared to a Mach 1.4 aircraft, respectively. This scaling rule can potentially yield a simple guideline for estimating an approximate noise limit for supersonic transport, depending on their cruise Mach number."],

As technology continues to advance and new training demands continue to emerge in the aviation industry, the use of modern training practices will become more predominant. It is therefore important to have an understanding of how modern training practices—in particular, virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), augmented reality (AR), or other immersive technologies, collectively referred to as extended reality (XR)—are best implemented in air carrier training. Thus, our research was aimed at (a) gathering and reviewing information related to the current state of the art of modern training practices and methodologies, (b) identifying how air carriers are currently implementing and evaluating these training approaches, and (c) providing information on potential future uses. Specifically, the goal was directed towards identifying and testing emergent technologies that could be suitable in specific areas of flightcrew training. The results of this research could serve to inform Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) personnel who update regulatory and guidance material which relate to air carrier pilot training, procedures, and operations.

A human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation study evaluated how FPM cognitive skills and knowledge may degrade using a between-subjects design with B737 and A320 type-rated pilots. Degradation resulting from time away from flying was assessed by comparing 24 participants belonging to one of three groups: (1) individuals who meet requirements as defined in 14 CFR 121.439 pilot qualification for recent experience (n = 8), (2) individuals who used to qualify for recent experience but whose last flight in one of those aircraft was 6-12 months in the past (n = 8), or (3) individuals who used to qualify for recent experience but whose last flight in one of those aircraft was 12 – 24 months in the past (n = 8). The twenty-four participants completed seven scenarios in their aircraft type with twelve participants in the A320 and twelve participants in the B737. Study findings suggest that declarative knowledge of the functions and interactions of the Flight Management System (FMS) and auto flight systems, including the flight director, autopilot, autothrottles, and flight mode annunciations are more susceptible to degradation than other types of knowledge. The cognitive skills of collection, integration, and estimation appear more susceptible to degradation than prediction, planning, and communication. In addition, pilots who had been away from flying for 12-24 months appeared to execute cognitive skills of information collection, integration, and estimation at a slightly slower frequency. Findings also suggest degradation in skill and decay in knowledge was not strictly due to time away from flying but may also result from other factors. Potential mitigations include continual reinforcement and training in self-assessment."],

This review discusses the development and assessment of probabilistic fuel property prediction methods in use today and vital for the formulation of these next-generation SAFs. We discuss the rigorous quality assurance specifications necessary for aviation fuels before they can be integrated into the supply network, with a particular emphasis on the stringent requirements for non-petroleum-based fuels or synthetic aviation turbine fuels. In this review, the relative merit of predictions based on component data and predictions derived from other modeling approaches is discussed. A total of 16 scalar products between a concentration vector (mass, mole, or volume fraction) and a property vector can be used to estimate 31 properties, counting the whole distillation curve as one property. The accuracy of these blending rules, as applied to mixtures of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons in the jet fuel volatility range, is documented here. The relative contribution of blending rule accuracy to the fuel property prediction uncertainty is discussed. In most (if not all) cases, the predictive uncertainty is small relative to uncertainties arising from incomplete characterization of the component concentration or property data and/or the accuracy of reported component property data. The data used to populate the property vector comes from authoritative sources, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Design Institute for Physical Properties (DIPPR), and the periodic table of elements, or internal measurements. Additionally, the freeze point can be estimated from the crucial components’ concentration and property data from a simple equation-of-state model (enthalpy, entropy, and temperature) applied to each of the crucial components. A total of 75 additional “properties” with specified criteria stated in ASTM D4054 follow directly from the measurement of trace or bulk materials or can be determined exactly from blending rules that invoke the conservation of mass.

A potential near-term and low-cost mitigation option is contrail avoidance, which involves rerouting aircraft around ice-supersaturated regions, preventing the formation of persistent contrails. Current forecasting methods for these regions of ice supersaturation have been found to be inaccurate when compared to in situ measurements. Further assessment and improvements of the quality of these predictions can be realized by comparison with observations of persistent contrails, such as those found in satellite imagery. In order to further enable comparison between these observations and contrail predictions, we develop a deep learning algorithm to estimate contrail altitudes based on GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) infrared imagery. This algorithm is trained using a dataset of 3267 contrails found within Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data and achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 570 m. The altitude estimation algorithm outputs probability distributions for the contrail top altitude in order to represent predictive uncertainty. The 95 % confidence intervals constructed using these distributions, which are shown to contain approximately 95 % of the contrail data points, are found to be 2.2 km thick on average. These intervals are found to be 34.1 % smaller than the 95 % confidence intervals constructed using flight altitude information alone, which are 3.3 km thick on average. Furthermore, we show that the contrail altitude estimates are consistent in time and, in combination with contrail detections, can be used to observe the persistence and three-dimensional (3D) evolution of contrail-forming regions from satellite images alone."],

Increases in airspeed and ground speed are both found to result in a reduction in the sound exposure level, but an increase in the equivalent level. This indicates that although an increase in flight speed increases noise generation, the reduced duration of the flyover still results in a decrease in sound exposure.

However, there is little empirical research evaluating the association between nighttime aircraft noise and hypertension risk. In this study, we expand on previous work to evaluate associations between nighttime aircraft noise exposure and self-reported hypertension incidence in the Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS/NHSII), two US-wide cohorts of female nurses. Annual nighttime average aircraft sound levels (Lnight) surrounding 90 airports for 1995–2015 (in 5-year intervals) were modeled using the Aviation Environmental Design Tool and assigned to participants’ geocoded addresses over time. Hypertension risk was estimated for each cohort using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models for Lnight dichotomized at 45 dB (dB), adjusting for individual-level hypertension risk factors, area-level socioeconomic status, region, and air pollution. Random effects meta-analysis was used to combine cohort results. Among 63,229 NHS and 98,880 NHSII participants free of hypertension at study baseline (1994/1995), we observed 33,190 and 28,255 new hypertension cases by 2014/2013, respectively. Although ~1% of participants were exposed to Lnight ≥45 dB, we observed an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.10 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.27) in NHS and adjusted HR of 1.12 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.28) in NHSII, comparing exposure to Lnight ≥45 versus <45 dB(A). In meta-analysis, we observed an adjusted HR of 1.11 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.23). These results were attenuated with adjustment for additional variables such as body mass index. Our findings support a modest positive association between nighttime aircraft noise and hypertension risk across NHS/NHSII, which may reinforce the concept that sleep disturbance contributes to noise-related disease burden."],

As for point sources, the Gaussian horizontal concentration distribution used to compute the contributions of the line sources is likely to overestimate ground-level concentrations when the wind speed is comparable to the standard deviation of the horizontal velocity fluctuations. A variety of methods are used to mitigate this overestimation under these conditions, referred to as meander. As an example of one these approaches, we examine that of AERMOD, EPA’s regulatory model. AERMOD includes meander in modeling the impact of point and volume sources, but has not yet incorporated it into AERMOD’s area source algorithm. This paper describes an approach to include meander in AERMOD’s area source algorithm and demonstrates its impact on concentrations associated with area sources."],

        "mods.abstract":["This research study aims at evaluating the benefits of using geosynthetics to reinforce/stabilize base aggregate layer/subgrade in pavements under repeated loading test conditions. For this purpose, a total of six 80-ft long and 13 ft wide full-scale test lane sections were constructed, among which two sections were reinforced by one or two layers of triaxial geogrids, two sections were reinforced by one layer of high strength woven geotextile with different base layer thickness, and the remaining two sections were the control sections. The field test sections were instrumented by a variety of sensors to measure the load- and environment-associated pavement response and performance. Two series of tests, moving wheel load tests and cyclic plate load tests, were conducted to investigate the field performance of geosynthetic reinforced/stabilized paved roads and to identify the differences in pavement response to moving wheel and cyclic plate loads. In addition, six similar test sections were constructed inside a 6.5-ft × 6.5-ft × 5.5-ft test box. The test box sections were also instrumented by a variety of sensors to measure the load-associated pavement response and performance. Laboratory cyclic plate load tests were then conducted. The results of accelerated load testing on the pavement test sections demonstrate the benefits of using geosynthetics in reducing the permanent deformation in the pavement structure. The adjusted traffic benefit ratio (TBRadj) associated with geosynthetic reinforcement can be increased up to 2.12 at a rut depth of 0.75 in. for pavement constructed using 18 in. thick base layer on top of weak subgrade soil using two layers of geogrid reinforcement. The inclusion of geosynthetics results in redistributing the applied load to a wider area, thus reducing the accumulated permanent deformation within the subgrade. The benefit of geosynthetics on reducing the maximum stress on top of subgrade is more appreciable at higher load levels. It was also found that the geosynthetics placed at the base-subgrade interface was able to improve the performance of both subgrade and base layers; by placing an additional layer of geogrid at the upper one-third of the base layer, the performance of the base layer was further enhanced. While geosynthetics showed appreciable benefit on reducing the permanent deformation of the subgrade layer, it showed less effect on the resilient properties of the subgrade layer. Drainage of the base layer has important effect on the performance of pavement structures for both unreinforced and reinforced lane sections. The life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) demonstrated the cost savings of using geosynthetics in pavement as compared to the unreinforced/untreated sections. However, compared to the 12-in. cement/lime treated subgrade with the cement stabilized base pavement section, the LCCA showed it is more cost effective to use geosynthetics for base thickness less than 12 in. (or < 15 in. of unreinforced aggregate base). The cost benefit becomes close for base thickness > 12 in. between using a single geosynthetic layer and a 12-in. cement/lime treated subgrade with a cement stabilized base. Moreover, the cost benefit of using double geogrid layers exceeds the cost savings of a 12-in. treated subgrade with a cement stabilized base."],

          "This research study aims at evaluating the benefits of using geosynthetics to reinforce/stabilize base aggregate layer/subgrade in pavements under repeated loading test conditions. For this purpose, a total of six 80-ft long and 13 ft wide full-scale test lane sections were constructed, among which two sections were reinforced by one or two layers of triaxial geogrids, two sections were reinforced by one layer of high strength woven geotextile with different base layer thickness, and the remaining two sections were the control sections. The field test sections were instrumented by a variety of sensors to measure the load- and environment-associated pavement response and performance. Two series of tests, moving wheel load tests and cyclic plate load tests, were conducted to investigate the field performance of geosynthetic reinforced/stabilized paved roads and to identify the differences in pavement response to moving wheel and cyclic plate loads. In addition, six similar test sections were constructed inside a 6.5-ft × 6.5-ft × 5.5-ft test box. The test box sections were also instrumented by a variety of sensors to measure the load-associated pavement response and performance. Laboratory cyclic plate load tests were then conducted. The results of accelerated load testing on the pavement test sections demonstrate the benefits of using geosynthetics in reducing the permanent deformation in the pavement structure. The adjusted traffic benefit ratio (TBRadj) associated with geosynthetic reinforcement can be increased up to 2.12 at a rut depth of 0.75 in. for pavement constructed using 18 in. thick base layer on top of weak subgrade soil using two layers of geogrid reinforcement. The inclusion of geosynthetics results in redistributing the applied load to a wider area, thus reducing the accumulated permanent deformation within the subgrade. The benefit of geosynthetics on reducing the maximum stress on top of subgrade is more appreciable at higher load levels. It was also found that the geosynthetics placed at the base-subgrade interface was able to improve the performance of both subgrade and base layers; by placing an additional layer of geogrid at the upper one-third of the base layer, the performance of the base layer was further enhanced. While geosynthetics showed appreciable benefit on reducing the permanent deformation of the subgrade layer, it showed less effect on the resilient properties of the subgrade layer. Drainage of the base layer has important effect on the performance of pavement structures for both unreinforced and reinforced lane sections. The life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) demonstrated the cost savings of using geosynthetics in pavement as compared to the unreinforced/untreated sections. However, compared to the 12-in. cement/lime treated subgrade with the cement stabilized base pavement section, the LCCA showed it is more cost effective to use geosynthetics for base thickness less than 12 in. (or < 15 in. of unreinforced aggregate base). The cost benefit becomes close for base thickness > 12 in. between using a single geosynthetic layer and a 12-in. cement/lime treated subgrade with a cement stabilized base. Moreover, the cost benefit of using double geogrid layers exceeds the cost savings of a 12-in. treated subgrade with a cement stabilized base.",

Pongamia oil was found to have similar characteristics as other plant seed oils (canola and jatropha) and would be expected to be well suited for hydroprocessed production of sustainable aviation fuel. Nitrogen containing species is retained in the solid phase during oil extraction, and the de-oiled seed cake exhibited enrichment in the N content, ∼5 to 6%, in comparison with the parent seed.

The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) is a federal program designed to subsidize farmers to establish, produce and deliver biomass feedstock to biorefineries. This study evaluated the impacts of BCAP on the optimal biofuel supply chain decisions considering feedstock yield uncertainty and associated investment risk given diverse risk preferences of the biofuel sector. The expected cost for a risk-neutral biofuel sector was minimized using a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear program, whereas the Conditional Value-at-Risk of the supply chain was optimized for a risk-averse sector. Ex-ante analysis of a switchgrass-based biofuel sector in west Tennessee indicates BCAP payments could lower expected cost and investment risk for both risk-averse and risk-neutral biofuel sectors. However, the cost saving and risk reduction resulting from BCAP incentives for the risk-averse biofuel sector were higher than the risk-neutral biofuel sector. In addition, BCAP payments may drive more cropland to be converted for switchgrass, which potentially mitigates water-induced soil erosion and reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with net carbon sequestration, but may also create unintended consequence of competition for land between food and fuel use."],

The three most common training devices are the hypobaric altitude chamber (AC), the normobaric reduced oxygen breathing device (ROBD), and the normobaric reduced oxygen breathing environment (ROBE). The AC creates hypoxic conditions using reduced atmospheric pressure. The ROBD and ROBE create normobaric hypoxic conditions by supplying a controlled reduced-oxygen gas mixture to trainees who don an aviation-style breathing mask or occupy a sealed chamber, respectively. To determine if differences in the transcriptional response to each of these training devices exist, blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) samples from ten volunteer participants were analyzed by microarray. The resulting gene expression measures were screened for significant changes across time points within and across device runs. Few genes were significant in these comparisons; the most significant differences between timepoints were observed in small nucleolar RNAs and noncoding RNAs, as well as one microRNA and one transfer RNA. The transcriptional response to each training device differs slightly as determined by differences in transcription between time points. However, the role of these transcriptional changes is unclear, as little information exists as to their function or role in the hypoxic response. As all the examined methods induced hypoxic symptoms, and very little difference was observed in gene expression between methods, this limited study did not detect the presence of substantial differences between hypoxia awareness training devices. Future studies using more sensitive sequencing-based gene expression analysis techniques and larger sample sizes may improve the detection of transcriptional differences induced by each training device."],

          "Hypoxia awareness training is a standard facet of military aviator training that is performed to familiarize aviators with the symptoms of hypoxia. The three most common training devices are the hypobaric altitude chamber (AC), the normobaric reduced oxygen breathing device (ROBD), and the normobaric reduced oxygen breathing environment (ROBE). The AC creates hypoxic conditions using reduced atmospheric pressure. The ROBD and ROBE create normobaric hypoxic conditions by supplying a controlled reduced-oxygen gas mixture to trainees who don an aviation-style breathing mask or occupy a sealed chamber, respectively. To determine if differences in the transcriptional response to each of these training devices exist, blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) samples from ten volunteer participants were analyzed by microarray. The resulting gene expression measures were screened for significant changes across time points within and across device runs. Few genes were significant in these comparisons; the most significant differences between timepoints were observed in small nucleolar RNAs and noncoding RNAs, as well as one microRNA and one transfer RNA. The transcriptional response to each training device differs slightly as determined by differences in transcription between time points. However, the role of these transcriptional changes is unclear, as little information exists as to their function or role in the hypoxic response. As all the examined methods induced hypoxic symptoms, and very little difference was observed in gene expression between methods, this limited study did not detect the presence of substantial differences between hypoxia awareness training devices. Future studies using more sensitive sequencing-based gene expression analysis techniques and larger sample sizes may improve the detection of transcriptional differences induced by each training device."],

Aviation's impact on surface air quality, which is comparable to aviation's climate impact when monetized, further heightens this challenge. Prior studies have proposed solutions that aim to mitigate either aviation's climate or air quality impacts. No previous work has proposed an aircraft-energy system that simultaneously addresses both aviation's climate and air quality impacts. In this paper we (1) use a multi-disciplinary design approach to optimize aircraft and propulsion systems, (2) estimate lifecycle costs and emissions of producing sustainable fuels including the embodied emissions associated with electricity generation and fuel production, (3) use trajectory optimization to quantify the fuel penalty to avoid persistent contrail formation based on a full year of global flight operations (including, for the first time, contrail avoidance for a hydrogen burning aircraft), and (4) quantify climate and air quality benefits of the proposed solutions using a simplified climate model and sensitivities derived from a global chemistry transport model. We propagate uncertainties in environmental impacts using a Monte-Carlo approach. We use these models to propose and analyze near-zero environmental impact aircraft, which we define as having net zero climate warming and a greater than 95% reduction in air quality impacts relative to present day. We contrast the environmental impacts of today's aircraft-energy system against one built around either “drop-in” fuels or hydrogen. We find that a “zero-impact” aircraft is possible using either hydrogen or power-to-liquid “drop-in” fuels. The proposed aircraft-energy systems reduce combined climate and air quality impacts by 99%, with fuel costs increasing by 40% for hydrogen and 70% for power-to-liquid fueled aircraft relative to today's fleet (i.e., within the range of historical jet fuel price variation). Beyond the specific case presented here, this work presents a framework for holistic analysis of future aviation systems that considers both climate and air quality impacts."],

This paper reviews research that could contribute to the data and processes that would be useful to the FAA in Aircraft Evaluation Division (AED) tasks. The more specific the human factors information, however, the less generalizable the finding and will need to be interpreted and applied within the context of the knowledge of specific functions. The best use of the information and processes in the literature would be to develop tools and specific guidance for AED personnel. These tools could increase the standardization of AED tasks and maintain the flexibility of the AED to decide what needs to be assessed, how it should be assessed, and how the results should be interpreted and applied. Research needed to progress the development of these tools and guidance is identified as well as recommended approaches. A repository of AED decisions would be useful in helping to guide decisions and increase standardization. Finally, the feasibility of de-identifying and compiling data on pilot performance and issues identified by pilots after final design approval should be explored."],

We describe a scalable, automated detection and matching (ADM) system to determine from satellite data whether a flight has made a persistent contrail. The ADM system compares flight segments to contrails detected by a computer vision algorithm running on images from the GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager. We develop a flight matching algorithm and use it to label each flight segment as a match or non-match. We perform this analysis on 1.6 million flight segments. The result is an analysis of which flights make persistent contrails several orders of magnitude larger than any previous work. We assess the agreement between our labels and available prediction models based on weather forecasts. Shifting air traffic to avoid regions of contrail formation has been proposed as a possible mitigation with the potential for very low cost/ton-CO2e. Our findings suggest that imperfections in these prediction models increase this cost/ton by about an order of magnitude. Contrail avoidance is a cost-effective climate change mitigation even with this factor taken into account, but our results quantify the need for more accurate contrail prediction methods and establish a benchmark for future development."],

The data were divided into two groups, the AQP-only control group, and the AQP+VR intervention group. The data represented training events (n = 13,525) spilt between AQP-only (n = 11,180) and AQP+VR (n = 2,345). The groups were compared in terms of cabin door training pass rates. Results. The observed training pass rate was 84% in the AQP group vs. 88% in the AQP+VR group. Conclusion. Supplemental XR training appeared to improve cabin door procedural training effectiveness, although there were some important study limitations resulting from the retrospective study design."],

          "cockpit environment. The scientific literature suggests certain females (pregnant, menopausal, elderly) are more likely to",
          "experience complications and have less than optimal visual performance after refractive surgery. This study reviews the",

          "Administration (FAA)-specific pathology codes 130 (radial keratotomy) and 5179 (general eye pathology with surgical",

          "INTRODUCTION. Refractive surgical procedures performed in the United States have increased in recent years and",
          "continued growth is projected. Postoperative side effects can affect the quality of vision and may be unacceptable in a",
          "cockpit environment. The scientific literature suggests certain females (pregnant, menopausal, elderly) are more likely to",
          "experience complications and have less than optimal visual performance after refractive surgery. This study reviews the",
          "civil aeromedical experience with refractive surgery by gender. METHODS. A list of airmen with Federal Aviation",
          "Administration (FAA)-specific pathology codes 130 (radial keratotomy) and 5179 (general eye pathology with surgical",
          "prefix), during the period 1 January 1994 through 31 December 1996, was generated from FAA medical databases. The",
          "records of airmen with pathology code 5179 were reviewed and those identified as having refractive surgery were collated",
          "into a database with those who had pathology code 130. The records were then stratified by class of medical certification",
          "and gender, and analyzed using demographic data extracted from FAA publications. RESULTS. There were 3,761",
          "airmen identified as having had refractive surgical procedures during the study period. The prevalence rate for refractive",
          "surgery was found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) for female (8.74/1,000) than for male (6.06/1,000) aviators.",
          "Prevalence rates for all classes of FAA medical certification were also found to be significantly higher for female aviators.",
          "CONCLUSIONS. Higher prevalence rates for female aviators with refractive surgical procedures suggest that they view",
          "refractive surgery to be a more viable alternative for correcting refractive error than do their male counterparts. With the",
          "more frequent post-surgical complications for selected females with these procedures, further research is recommended to",

        "mods.abstract":["Airports around the nation are considering expansion plans in order to meet increasing demand for aviation transport. There are increasing concerns, as well, about how and to what extent air pollutant emissions from airports contribute to local and regional air quality degradation and hence to negative impacts on human health and welfare. However, it is difficult to quantify the amount, transport, and secondary conversion processes of aircraft emissions, which usually comprise the bulk of airport-attributable emissions. This is due to four reasons: 1. Difficulty of determining the actual amounts of emissions from aircraft and characterizing the chemical speciation. 2. Difficulty of determining, at the particle level, the secondary chemical transformations that occur. 3. Difficulty in detection of the species and identification of the aircraft contribution in a region where air quality degradation is a consequence of emissions from multiple sources, both natural and anthropogenic. For the project described in this report, the technique of stable isotopic measurements was utilized in an attempt to develop and assess the impact of aircraft emissions in a region. The theme was, “Are the aircraft emissions recognizable at the isotopic level in a region and are they separable from other sulfates?” To explore this theme, the project team performed three measurement campaigns at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to sample aerosol sulfate and characterize the isotopic composition of oxygen atoms in the sulfate particles. It was hoped that aerosol sulfate from jet engines would be shown to have a distinct isotopic character in comparison to sulfate from other sources such as diesel engines, aiding attribution of degraded air quality to jet aircraft sources. The premise that the oxygen isotopic composition of aerosol sulfate could be used to define jet contributions to a region was ultimately not conclusively supported by the study presented in this report. It appears that at low humidity an isotopic anomaly is preferentially created, as observed in the first Aviation Alternative Fuels Experiment (AAFEX), thus identifying a jet aircraft engine. At the humidity of LAX however, the presence of excess water on the aerosol surfaces dilutes the anomaly. Hence, for assessment of the potential of the technique to be broadly applied, it is likely that only low-humidity areas would be capable of providing the signature, based upon the experiments conducted to-date. Furthermore, unexpectedly low sulfate concentrations were observed in the study, suggesting that jet engine exhaust SO2 oxidation occurs further away from LAX and optimal sampling sites in future studies would need to be done at further distances. However, it is unlikely that increased distance between the source sulfur and the sampling monitors at LAX will show much isotopic anomaly in high humidity conditions (60+ %). Conceptually, the potential remains for isotopic analysis to quantitatively address the contributions from aircraft jet engines to degraded air quality near airports. If future research is performed on this technique, an airport in a dry environment must be selected as an initial candidate so that the methods initially explored in this report can be retried. Monitors may need to be located further away from the airport environment so that engine SO2 has more opportunity to become sulfate."],
