dot:64805,,13-C-AJFF-UD-026,"Already low volume (<1mL) test methods facilitate the development of sustainable aviation fuel platforms and higher fidelity computational methods. Here a novel technique with two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) and Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) identification is used to characterize fuel composition and determine properties compared to previous work. Ten properties are predicted\, including the temperature dependence of density\, viscosity\, thermal conductivity\, and heat capacity. Property predictions incorporate uncertainty quantification (UQ) from analyte quantification (UQ1)\, root property uncertainty (UQ2)\, and the uncertainty associated with isomeric variance (UQ3)\, when an analyte is not identified via VUV. Comparisons to a previous method illustrate the ability of VUV identification to increase the fidelity of property predictions and decrease uncertainties. This method is applied to a surrogate intended to mimic the first-order properties and composition of a representative Jet A/A-1.

Here a novel technique with two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) and Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) identification is used to characterize fuel composition and determine properties compared to previous work. Ten properties are predicted\, including the temperature dependence of density\, viscosity\, thermal conductivity\, and heat capacity. Property predictions incorporate uncertainty quantification (UQ) from analyte quantification (UQ1)\, root property uncertainty (UQ2)\, and the uncertainty associated with isomeric variance (UQ3)\, when an analyte is not identified via VUV. Comparisons to a previous method illustrate the ability of VUV identification to increase the fidelity of property predictions and decrease uncertainties. This method is applied to a surrogate intended to mimic the first-order properties and composition of a representative Jet A/A-1.

This modeling approach may also include the preprocessing and storage of feedstocks at depots. Labor/salary requirements and renewable identification number (RIN) values and credits attributable to the conversion facility\, along with land-use changes for growing the feedstock are also included in the supply chain analyses. The investment and annual operating of renewable energy technologies for electricity generation for wind\, solar\, and digesters are modeled as well. Recent modeling emphasis has centered on the supply chain for liquid fuels using the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s 179 economic trading areas as modeling regions. These various data layers necessary to estimate the economic impact are contained in UT’s renewable energy economic analysis layers (REEAL) modeling system. This analysis provides an example scenario to demonstrate REEAL’s modeling capabilities. The conversion technology modeled is a gasification Fischer–Tropsch biorefinery with feedstock input of 495\,000 metric tons per year of forest residue transported to a logging road that is less than one mile in distance. The biorefinery is expected to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)\, diesel\, and naphtha. An estimated one million tons of forest residue are required at fifty percent moisture content. Based on a technical economic assessment (TEA) developed by the Aviation Sustainability Center (ASCENT) and the quantity of hardwood residues available in the Central Appalachian region\, three biorefineries could be sited each utilizing 495\,000 dry metric tons per year. Each biorefinery could produce 47.5 million liters of SAF\, 40.3 million liters of diesel\, and 23.6 million liters of naphtha. Annual gross revenues for fuel required for the biorefineries to break even are estimated at $193.7 million per biorefinery. Break-even plant gate fuel prices when assuming RINs and 12.2 percent return on investment are $1.12 per liter for SAF\, $1.15 per liter for diesel\, and $0.97 per liter for naphtha. Based on IMPLAN\, an input–output model\, and an investment of $1.7 billion\, the estimated economic annual impact to the Central Appalachian region if the three biorefineries are sited is over a half a billion dollars. Leakages occur as investment dollars leaving the region based on the regions local purchase coefficients (i.e.\, LPPs)\, which totals $500 million. This results in an estimated $2.67 billion in economic activity with a multiplier of 1.7\, or for every million dollars spent\, an additional $0.7 million in economic activity is generated in the regional economy. Gross regional product is estimated at $1.28 billion and employment of nearly 1\,200 jobs are created during the construction period of the biorefineries\, which results in $700 million in labor income with multiplier effects. Economic activity for the feedstock operations (harvesting and chipping) is estimated at slightly more than $16.8 million resulting in an additional $30 million in the economic impact. The stumpage and additional profit occurring from the harvest of the forest residues result in $40 million directly into the pockets of the resource and logging operation owners. Their subsequent expenditures resulted in a total economic activity increase of $71.4 million.

dot:64815,,13-C-AJFF-PSU-031,"The United States\, spurred in part by international developments\, is expanding its law and policy to incentivize the use of sustainable aviation fuels. While the U.S. has agreed to participate in the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO’s) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)\, it has only recently adopted federal rules that define greenhouse gas emission reduction standards for certain classes of airplanes (effective January 2021). However\, such standards focus on engine efficiency rather than the fuel burned. For sustainable aviation fuels\, the U.S. continues to rely on voluntary programs at a federal\, state\, and regional level. The federal Renewable Fuel Standard program allows producers to opt in. In addition\, states have started to allow sustainable aviation fuel producers to “opt in” to their programs; this includes California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard\, Oregon’s Clean Fuels Program\, and Washington’s newly adopted Clean Fuels Program. Other states are also starting to consider such programs. Elsewhere\, states like Hawaii are starting to support SAF production in other ways\, including through tax mechanisms. In addition\, regional and private efforts to adopt and/or promote sustainable aviation fuels are underway. This piecemeal approach—due in part to the lack of cohesive U.S. federal policy—stands in contrast to the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive and Emissions Trading System\, and adoption of policies by European countries. Because of aviation’s international nature\, tracking what is happening in Europe matters greatly for U.S. carriers.

For sustainable aviation fuels\, the U.S. continues to rely on voluntary programs at a federal\, state\, and regional level. The federal Renewable Fuel Standard program allows producers to opt in. In addition\, states have started to allow sustainable aviation fuel producers to “opt in” to their programs; this includes California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard\, Oregon’s Clean Fuels Program\, and Washington’s newly adopted Clean Fuels Program. Other states are also starting to consider such programs. Elsewhere\, states like Hawaii are starting to support SAF production in other ways\, including through tax mechanisms. In addition\, regional and private efforts to adopt and/or promote sustainable aviation fuels are underway. This piecemeal approach—due in part to the lack of cohesive U.S. federal policy—stands in contrast to the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive and Emissions Trading System\, and adoption of policies by European countries. Because of aviation’s international nature\, tracking what is happening in Europe matters greatly for U.S. carriers. As the U.S. works to meet its international obligations through CORSIA\, finding a way forward with sustainable aviation fuel in the United States may depend on a more defined federal policy. Actions taken by both the EU and European countries offers some guidance for actions that could be taken by the U.S. Even in the absence of more defined measures\, better tracking of voluntary measures is a critical step.",2021-11-01,PDF,,,United States,,2022-11-21T21:27:34.570Z,,Journal Article,,Frontiers in Energy Research,application/pdf,01-fenrg-09-750514_pub.pdf,1580551,urn:sha256:73dd7098e01795e7a7f1ad5c3e033f87a8c13eca34c51e4a9d5ac6f5faceac15,2021,,dot:53566,"https://doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2021.750514,https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/64815","Korkut\, Ekrem,Fowler\, Lara B",,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2021.750514,1452,,,,,,Frontiers in Energy Research,PDF,Journal Article,"Korkut\, Ekrem,Fowler\, Lara B,United States.

Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides (NOx and SOx) contribute to these impacts. However\, the relative contributions and mechanisms linking these emissions to formation and impacts of secondary aerosols (as opposed to direct aerosol emissions) have not been quantified\, including how short-lived aerosol precursors at altitude can increase surface-level aerosol concentrations. We apply global chemistry transport modeling to identify and quantify the different chemical pathways to aerosol formation from aviation emissions\, including the resulting impact on radiative forcing. We estimate a net aerosol radiative forcing of –8.3 mWm−2\, of which –0.67 and –7.8 mWm−2 result from nitrate and sulfate aerosols respectively. We find that aviation NOx causes –1.7 mWm−2 through nitrate aerosol forcing but also –1.6 mWm−2 of sulfate aerosol forcing by promoting oxidation of SO2 to sulfate aerosol. This accounts for 21% of the total sulfate forcing\, and oxidation of SO2 due to aviation NOx is responsible for 47% of the net aviation NOx attributable RF. Aviation NOx emissions in turn account for 41% of net aviation-aerosol-attributable RF (non-contrail). This is due to ozone-mediated oxidation of background sulfur and the 'nitrate bounce-back' effect\, which reduces the net impact of sulfur emissions. The ozone-mediated mechanism also explains the ability of cruise aviation emissions to significantly affect surface aerosol concentrations. We find that aviation NOx emissions cause 72% of aviation-attributable\, near-surface aerosol loading by mass\, compared to 27% from aviation SOx emissions and less than 0.1% from direct emission of black carbon.

In addition\, sensitivity analysis suggests advancing SAF conversion rate from biomass could lower the SAF break-even considerably and enhance the competitiveness of SAF over CJF.",2021-12-01,PDF,,,United States,,2022-11-21T21:27:44.273Z,,Journal Article,,Frontiers in Energy Research,application/pdf,01-fenrg-09-775389_pub.pdf,3613388,urn:sha256:9421165be525b10707387b186ef73d5f06114622b8defa92c86cda3139931c98,2021,,dot:53566,"https://doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2021.775389,https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/64820","Sharma\, Bijay P,Yu\, T Edward,English\, Burton C,Boyer\, Christopher N",,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2021.775389,1452,,,,,,Frontiers in Energy Research,PDF,Journal Article,"Sharma\, Bijay P,Yu\, T Edward,English\, Burton C,Boyer\, Christopher N,United States.

dot:58958,,13-C-AJFE-SU-010,"Transportation fuels consist of a large number of species that belong to different families of compounds. Surrogate fuel representations have been formulated to better understand their fundamental chemical composition and to emulate combustion properties. These descriptions are formulated using experiments or through computations\, which has thus led to the existence of two different notions of surrogates. There is further distinction of concepts through the use of physical and chemical surrogates\, which are designed to emulate those specific properties. Although several surrogate design methodologies have been proposed in literature\, they do not incorporate information on experimental uncertainty. By addressing this issue\, it is shown that this information is crucial for the reliable construction of surrogates through computations. To incorporate physical fuel properties\, a consistent approach through the use of the recent ASTM D2887 distillation curve standard is discussed. Then\, a formal computational procedure is presented that incorporates information of experimental uncertainties into the surrogate description. It is shown that surrogates then describe a feasible region and are hence not unique. Both physical and chemical properties are utilized as combustion property targets (CPTs) and consistency with experimental formulations is demonstrated for JP-8 and Jet-A (POSF 4658) surrogates. In addition\, the use of convex optimization puts existing concepts for surrogate representation on a more rigorous basis and several conclusions are drawn\, particularly on the importance of specific CPTs and weighting factors of regression-based approaches. Also\, the effect of using simplified models for the evaluation of CPTs on the final surrogate composition is shown by considering the example of linear blending rules for ignition delay. Finally\, the surrogate representation problem is connected to multi-parametric optimization and bounds on surrogate compositions are calculated as a function of the experimental uncertainty along with comparisons against experimental results.",Active,Formulation of Optimal Surrogate Descriptions of Fuels Considering Sensitivities to Experimental Uncertainties,English,"Alternate fuels,Aviation fuels,Combustion,Sensitivity analysis,Uncertainty,Metrics (Quantitative assessment),Parametric analysis,Surrogate fuel,Combustion property target,Parametric optimization,Uncertainty quantification,ASCENT",2022-01-05T13:22:05.827Z,Federal Aviation Administration,English,Formulation of Optimal Surrogate Descriptions of Fuels Considering Sensitivities to Experimental Uncertainties,j.combustflame.2017.09.044,,"United States.

Manuscript_1d9c19cef2188851c03a33439e2c3d96,Transportation fuels consist of a large number of species that belong to different families of compounds. Surrogate fuel representations have been formulated to better understand their fundamental chemical composition and to emulate combustion properties. These descriptions are formulated using experiments or through computations\, which has thus led to the existence of two different notions of surrogates. There is further distinction of concepts through the use of physical and chemical surrogates\, which are designed to emulate those specific properties. Although several surrogate design methodologies have been proposed in literature\, they do not incorporate information on experimental uncertainty. By addressing this issue\, it is shown that this information is crucial for the reliable construction of surrogates through computations. To incorporate physical fuel properties\, a consistent approach through the use of the recent ASTM D2887 distillation curve standard is discussed. Then\, a formal computational procedure is presented that incorporates information of experimental uncertainties into the surrogate description. It is shown that surrogates then describe a feasible region and are hence not unique. Both physical and chemical properties are utilized as combustion property targets (CPTs) and consistency with experimental formulations is demonstrated for JP-8 and Jet-A (POSF 4658) surrogates. In addition\, the use of convex optimization puts existing concepts for surrogate representation on a more rigorous basis and several conclusions are drawn\, particularly on the importance of specific CPTs and weighting factors of regression-based approaches. Also\, the effect of using simplified models for the evaluation of CPTs on the final surrogate composition is shown by considering the example of linear blending rules for ignition delay. Finally\, the surrogate representation problem is connected to multi-parametric optimization and bounds on surrogate compositions are calculated as a function of the experimental uncertainty along with comparisons against experimental results.,1226",2017-11-01,PDF,,,United States,,2021-12-13T18:46:09.581Z,,Manuscript,,Elsevier,application/pdf,29-j.combustflame.2017.09.044_pub.pdf,11035031,urn:sha256:2bf1cd5357b833842e537adf9942a31aa4c802d4cb3c7abc938619657048cc9b,2017,,dot:53566,,"Govindaraju\, Pavan Bharadwaj,Ihme\, Matthias",,,,1226,,,,,,,,,,,https://ntlrepository.blob.core.windows.net/lib/83000/83300/83373/29-j.combustflame.2017.09.044_pub.pdf,,,,,This manuscript is made available under the Elsevier user license https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/ .

In addition to existing sensors for 1-butene\, methane\, ethylene\, 1\,3-butadiene\, propene\, allene\, benzene\, and cyclopentadiene\, a new laser absorption sensor for ethane at 3.3519 um was developed by measuring cross-sections of ethane and of expected major interferers. Additional measurements to complete a square absorption cross-section matrix were also performed that enabled the simultaneous solution of species mole fractions from absorbance time-histories under appropriate physical system constraints. Measured time-histories of the nine product species were also compared with existing flow-reactor-based kinetic mechanisms. The demonstrated method has further application potential in the speciation of larger\, more complex fuels.,1199",2019-02-01,PDF,,,United States,,2021-08-09T14:47:02.679Z,,Manuscript,Journal Article,Elsevier,application/pdf,25-j.fuel.2019.01.154_pub_Multi-wavelength.pdf,2847077,urn:sha256:2e93c05b906d732f0cb2fc07c859d3594f260c45e013e7d2dd397c78aa5c39cb,2019,,dot:53566,,"Pinkowski\, Nicolas H,Cassady\, Sean J,Davidson\, David F,Hanson\, Ronald K",,,,1199,,,,,,,,,,,https://ntlrepository.blob.core.windows.net/lib/81000/81700/81702/25-j.fuel.2019.01.154_pub_Multi-wavelength.pdf,,,,,"This manuscript is made available under the Elsevier user license,https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0",United States.

dot:64819,,13-C-AJFF-WaSU-013,"Site selection modeling receives much attention in the aviation biofuels literature to ensure sustainability of the aviation biofuel supply chain. These models seek to reflect the multitude of factors and conditions necessary for supply chain success. Social factors impacting that success have received increasingly greater attention but are often excluded due to difficulties in obtaining accurate and standard measures. Some of the most promising work in this arena utilizes a “community capitals approach” to create statistically grounded decision support tools (DSTs) intended to provide rapid assessment of the social characteristics of potential facility locations. Despite the value of the community capitals approach\, this methodology is still marked by inconsistent predictivity due to an inability to reliably assess the cultural and historical nuances of local communities that are so vitally important to the long-term viability of these costly projects. This paper more fully examines the Community Assets and Attributes Model (CAAM) that has been developed and applied in the Pacific Northwest to incorporate social assets in site selection modeling. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Colorado and Wyoming dealing with biomass/bioenergy facility siting\, we argue that cultural capital\, a key component of the CAAM\, is biased to urban locations due to the measurements incorporated. As a result of this bias\, current site selection modeling based on the Community Capitals Framework (CCF) does not accurately reflect rural community assets. We assert that the CAAM does not actually measure cultural capital but a product of cultural capital\, namely creativity\, and innovation Our mixed methods approach that combines quantitative assessment with ethnographic research highlights the limits of the CAAM by revealing that local residents in largely rural counties showed willingness to innovate in some cases but in others referred to history with similar industries that may limit support. The quantitative cultural capital measurements of the CAAM for the four counties we examine\, which range in scores from −0.53 to 2\, do not capture these dynamics. These scores would generally suggest moderate to high levels of support for biomass/bioenergy facilities\, but the ethnographic research provides nuance for or against support that are not reflected in the quantitative capital scores. This suggests that the quantitative CAAM scores could be misleading without added qualitative context. This work demonstrates that a mixed methods approach\, combining ethnographic and historical methodologies with existing quantitative community capital approaches\, will produce a more effective predictive methodology for facility siting due to its heightened ability to gather critical data on place-based values\, beliefs\, and historical legacies relating to natural resource development in general\, and the timber industry specifically.",Active,Searching for Culture in “Cultural Capital”: The Case for a Mixed Methods Approach to Production Facility Siting,English,"Aviation fuels,Biomass fuels,Cultural resources,Location,Sustainable transportation,Sustainable development,Ethnic groups,Interviewing,Wood,community assets,attributes model,ASCENT",2022-12-19T18:56:38.305Z,Federal Aviation Administration,English,Searching for Culture in “Cultural Capital”: The Case for a Mixed Methods Approach to Production Facility Siting,fenrg-09-772316,"Aviation fuels,Biomass fuels,Cultural resources,Location,Sustainable transportation,Sustainable development,Ethnic groups,Interviewing,Wood,community assets,attributes model,ASCENT","United States.

Assessments of supersonic aircraft emissions impacts over the last decade have focused on the ozone and climate impacts of nitrogen oxides and water vapor\, but assumed zero-sulfur fuel\, zero black carbon emissions\, and neglect likely design constraints on near-future engine technology. We assess the impacts on atmospheric composition and non-CO2 climate forcing of a near-future supersonic aircraft fleet with current-generation engine technology burning fossil-based kerosene fuel with current-day sulfur content. Using vehicle performance modeling\, market demand projection and global atmospheric chemistry-transport modeling\, we find that a supersonic fleet flying at Mach 1.6 and 15–17 km altitude\, burning 19 Tg of fuel each year and emitting 170 Gg of NOx would cause a 0.046% reduction in global column ozone. We estimate the radiative forcing (climate impact) from changes in atmospheric concentrations of ozone (2.9 mW m-2)\, water vapor (1.3 mW m-2)\, carbonaceous and inorganic aerosols (-6.6 mW m-2)\, and methane (-0.65 mW m-2)\, resulting in a net non-CO2\, non-contrail forcing of -3.5 mW m-2 and varying from -3.0 to -3.9 mW per m2 per year to year. We also show that the use of zero-sulfur fuel would halve net ozone depletion but increases the net non-CO2 non-contrail forcing to +2.8 mW m-2 due to the loss of a cooling effect from sulfate aerosols. A smaller fleet of Mach 2.2 aircraft flying at 18–20 km and burning 14 Tg of fuel but emitting twice as much NOx per unit of fuel results in 17 times as much net ozone depletion. The net radiative forcing for this fleet is of uncertain sign\, averaging -0.15 mW m-2 but varying between -3.2 and +2.0 mW per m2 per year to year. Our results show that assessments of near-future supersonic aviation must consider the effects of fuel sulfur and black carbon alongside emissions of water vapor\, NOx\, and CO2\, and that the net environmental impacts will be a trade-off between competing environmental concerns.",Active,Impacts of a Near-Future Supersonic Aircraft Fleet on Atmospheric Composition and Climate,English,"Supersonic aircraft,Climate,Atmosphere,Properties of the atmosphere,Environmental impacts,Pollutants,ASCENT",2022-12-19T18:56:50.445Z,Federal Aviation Administration,English,Impacts of a Near-Future Supersonic Aircraft Fleet on Atmospheric Composition and Climate,d1ea00081k,"Supersonic aircraft,Climate,Atmosphere,Properties of the atmosphere,Environmental impacts,Pollutants,ASCENT",United States.

In this study\, we examined NRS waypoint human factors issues that exist with regard to their nomenclature or use since their deployment approximately five years ago. The focus of this study has been predominantly on the human factors issues of NRS Waypoints for flight deck operators\, although some information about issues that exist for air traffic controllers also have been collected and analyzed. We found that pilots and controllers tend to think of NRS waypoints in the same ways in which they think of traditionally named waypoints when seeing them on a flight plan and pilots do not believe they contribute to any particular CRM issues on the flight deck or require any changes to pilot flying and pilot monitoring roles and responsibilities. Dispatchers\, in particular\, agreed that NRS waypoints provide greater flexibility in route planning\, especially in the western portion of the US where fewer ground based navigation aids exist. The pilots we interviewed indicated that they restrict their usage of NRS waypoints to original flight planning only (i.e.\, a strategic use). They reported that when using them tactically while enroute\, such as for a diversion around weather\, their workload could become quite high. Another problem we learned about is that many flight management system (FMS) databases lack the storage capacity to hold all 1600 NRS waypoints in addition to all the other RNAV and named waypoints in the NAS. This creates a need for the flight crew to program waypoint locations using lat/long entries\, which is time consuming\, difficult\, and prone to data entry errors.

Sharing OSBL infrastructures resulted in reductions of the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) by 3–14% relative to the corresponding standalone cases. Co-processing of intermediate products such as VB-derived long chain hydrocarbons\, ATJ-derived ethanol\, DSHC-derived farnesene\, pyrolysis-derived bio-oil\, and GFT-derived FT products reduced the MFSP by 10–19% from corresponding standalone cases. Moreover\, repurposing scenarios reduced the costs by 16–34%. Greenhouse gas (GHG) estimations showed that 17 of 21 integrated scenarios resulted in GHG savings (7–92%). Lignocellulosic SAF technologies are limited by low fuel yields\, which are governed by the high oxygen content of the feedstock. However\, ICGFT was found to be advantageous in terms of fuel production at a maximized fuel yield.",2021-10-01,PDF,,,United States,,2022-11-21T21:27:32.450Z,,Journal Article,,Frontiers in Energy Research,application/pdf,01-fenrg-09-735661_pub.pdf,2541013,urn:sha256:42ec74849cdd6ea8f434de154b4d0ed1fecd5018624b07d1e18ec973c17acddc,2021,,dot:53566,"https://doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2021.735661,https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/64814","Tanzil\, Abid H,Brandt\, Kristin,Zhang\, Xiao,Wolcott\, Michael P.,Stockle\, Claudio,Garcia-Perez\, Manuel",,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2021.735661,1452,,,,,,Frontiers in Energy Research,PDF,Journal Article,"Tanzil\, Abid H,Brandt\, Kristin,Zhang\, Xiao,Wolcott\, Michael P.,Stockle\, Claudio,Garcia-Perez\, Manuel,United States.

dot:62288,,DTFAWA-10-A-80021,"As DataComm is a key enabling technology that significantly affects human performance\, human factors experts have anticipated potential implementation challenges (Cardosi\, Lennertz and Donahoe (2010). One significant issue is that DataComm equipment may not be integrated with flight management systems (FMS). The crew will be required to read the DataComm messages\, interpret them\, make decisions with respect to the flight\, and then make the appropriate FMS input. There will be challenges for the flight crew even when DataComm and FMS flight deck systems are fully integrated. Current aircraft systems that have incorporated datalink to some extent have utilized text to provide clearances or messages from ATC to the pilot. Presenting spatial information to pilots via text only requires pilots to perform a mental transformation that can not only slow down the understanding of the messages\, but also lead to interpretation errors. Thus\, this research addressing presentation methods of ATC information received on the flight deck via DataComm is high priority. Volume 1 includes findings and recommendations for the flight deck user interface. Volume 2 describes the results of the studies and details the methods\, results and discussion of each study. Experiment I investigated pilot performance using text uplink messages (UMs) concatenated into clearances versus a hybrid of graphics and text when evaluating ATC clearances. The results indicated that overall as the number of elements in a clearance increased the time required to interpret the clearance increased and errors increased. Hybrid conditions with graphics and text improved performance when there were 3 or more elements in a clearance.

One significant issue is that DataComm equipment may not be integrated with flight management systems (FMS). The crew will be required to read the DataComm messages\, interpret them\, make decisions with respect to the flight\, and then make the appropriate FMS input. There will be challenges for the flight crew even when DataComm and FMS flight deck systems are fully integrated. Current aircraft systems that have incorporated datalink to some extent have utilized text to provide clearances or messages from ATC to the pilot. Presenting spatial information to pilots via text only requires pilots to perform a mental transformation that can not only slow down the understanding of the messages\, but also lead to interpretation errors. Thus\, this research addressing presentation methods of ATC information received on the flight deck via DataComm is high priority. Volume 1 includes findings and recommendations for the flight deck user interface. Volume 2 describes the results of the studies and details the methods\, results and discussion of each study. Experiment I investigated pilot performance using text uplink messages (UMs) concatenated into clearances versus a hybrid of graphics and text when evaluating ATC clearances. The results indicated that overall as the number of elements in a clearance increased the time required to interpret the clearance increased and errors increased. Hybrid conditions with graphics and text improved performance when there were 3 or more elements in a clearance. The results also indicated improvements in the number of correct responses when graphics are included. Experiments II and III evaluated pilot performance for responding to clearances and creation of downlink messages to ATC using two interfaces. Pilots were able to create requests more quickly and with greater accuracy when using the graphic-based drag and drop interface that automatically updated the text DM.,1328",2013-02-28,PDF,,,United States,,2022-05-31T20:32:35.639Z,,Tech Report,Final Report,United States.

The objective here is thus to expand analysis capabilities to enable modeling of the impact on aircraft noise due to advanced operational approach procedures\, such as delayed deceleration approaches and thrust cutback scheduling on takeoff\, for both current and future aircraft designs. Current industry standard noise models rely on flight test data interpolation and do not fully capture noise impacts from airframe configuration or advanced operational techniques. This is critical for noise assessment because airframe noise becomes a significant factor relative to the low thrust levels characteristic of advanced operational approaches. This method also limits the ability to assess new aircraft designs. Therefore\, a new method combining aircraft sizing and performance tools with NASA’s Aircraft NOise Prediction Program (ANOPP) has been developed to capture those noise impacts. ANOPP is used because of its capability of computing noise received at ground observers due to both engines and airframe of aircraft flying any flight procedure. Inputs into ANOPP are the aircraft geometry\, the flight procedure\, and the engine performance during the flight procedure. The Transport Aircraft System OPTimization (TASOPT) model is used to compute the engine performance inputs into ANOPP via first principles\, physics-based methods.

dot:56852,,13-C-AJFE-GIT-008,"This paper describes an analysis of the near-lean blow off(LBO) dynamics of spray flames\, including the influence of fuel composition upon these dynamics. It is motivated by the fact that\, while reasonable correlations exist for predicting blow off conditions\, the fundamental reasons for why flames supported by flow recirculation actually blow off are not well understood. Prior work on gaseous systems has shown that the blow off event is a culmination of several intermediate processes\, initiating with local extinction of reactions (“stage 1”)\, followed by large scale changes in flame and flow dynamics (“stage 2”)\, finally leading to blow off. In this study\, near-LBO dynamics were characterized for ten liquid fuels with widely varying kinetic and physical properties. Results were compared at two air inlet temperatures\, 450 and 300 K\, as this influences the relative importance of physical and kinetic properties in controlling LBO. Extinction\, re-ignition\, and recovery of the flame are evident from these data\, and grow in frequency as blow off is approached. Results show that after a near-blow off event\, the flame can move upstream at velocities much faster than the flow velocity\, corresponding to re-ignition. Nonetheless\, the majority of the flame recovery events appear to be associated with convection of hot products back upstream\, not re-ignition. In contrast\, downstream motion of the flame faster than the flow\, which would correspond to bulk flame extinction\, was never observed. This indicates that “extinction events” actually correspond to convection of the flame downstream by the flow when it loses its stabilization point. The dependence of the equivalence ratio when these events appear\, their frequency\, and event duration were quantified as a function of fuel composition and air inlet temperature. For example\, the data shows a higher percentage of recovery from near-blow off events through re-ignition for high DCN fuels at the 450 K air temperature condition. These extinction/re-ignition results suggest that high DCN fuels are harder to blow off than low DCN fuels through two mechanisms: (1) by delaying the onset of LBO precursor events\, and (2) because they are able to recover from these precursor events through re-ignition more often.",Active,Near-Lean Blow Off Dynamics in a Liquid Fueled Combustor,English,"Alternate fuels,Cetane number,Flammability,Ignition,Lean Blowout (LBO),Alternative Jet Fuels,Derived Cetane Number (DCN),Extinction Re-ignition",2021-11-10T14:03:39.069Z,Federal Aviation Administration,English,Near-Lean Blow Off Dynamics in a Liquid Fueled Combustor,j.combustflame.2019.10.010,,"United States.

dot:56977,,13-C-AJFE-UI-,"The projected increase in global air traffic raises concerns about the potential impact aviation emissions have on climate and air quality. Previous studies have shown that aircraft non-landing and take-off (non-LTO) emissions (emitted above 1 km) can affect surface air quality by increasing concentrations of ozone (O3) and fine particles (PM2.5). Here\, we examine the global impacts of aviation non-LTO emissions on surface air quality for present day and mid-century (2050) using the Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry\, version 5 (CAM5). An important update in CAM5 over previous versions is the modal aerosol module (MAM)\, which provides a more accurate aerosol representation. Additionally we evaluate of the aviation impact at mid-century with two fuel scenarios\, a fossil fuel (SC1) and a biofuel (Alt). Monthly-mean results from the present day simulations show a northern hemisphere (NH) mean surface O3 increase of 1.3 ppb (2.7% of the background) and a NH maximum surface PM2.5 increase of 1.4 μg/m3 in January. Mid-century simulations show slightly greater surface O3 increases (mean of 1.9 ppb (4.2%) for both scenarios) and greater PM2.5 increases (maximum of 3.5 μg/m3 for SC1 and 2.2 μg/m3 for Alt).

However\, producing biomass-based SAFs may induce changes in global land use and the associated carbon stock. The induced land use change (ILUC) emissions\, as a part of the full life-cycle emissions for SAF pathways\, will affect whether and to what extent SAFs reduce emissions compared with petroleum-based jet fuels. Here\, we estimate the ILUC emission intensity for seventeen SAF pathways considered by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)\, covering five ASTM-certified technologies\, nine biomass-based feedstocks\, and four geographical regions. We introduce the SAF pathways into a well-established computable general equilibrium (CGE) model\, GTAP-BIO\, and its coupled emission accounting model\, AEZ-EF\, to study economy-wide implications of SAF production and estimate ILUC emissions intensity for each pathway. The estimated SAF ILUC emission intensities\, using a 25-year amortization period\, range from −58.5 g CO2e MJ−1 for the USA miscanthus alcohol (isobutanol)-to-jet (ATJ) pathway to 34.6 g CO2e MJ−1 for the Malaysia & Indonesia palm oil Hydrotreated Esters of Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway. Notably\, the vegetable oil pathways tend to have higher ILUC emission intensities due to their linkage to palm expansion and peatland oxidation in Southeast Asia. The cellulosic pathways studied provide negative ILUC emissions\, mainly driven by the high carbon sequestrations in crop biomass and soil.

Both first principles and semi-empirical prediction tools have been developed as a result of this research. This project will leverage that research and use tools developed by the research team to develop noise abatement flight procedures and a flight test plan to evaluate the effectiveness to those procedures. The noise prediction system will also be used to demonstrate its utility in predicting the noise from advance rotorcraft features and concepts.,1199",2017-04-06,PDF,,,United States,,2021-07-27T18:14:55.997Z,,Tech Report,Final Report,United States.

dot:57505,,2014-AAM-612-GEN-10091,"Aircraft passengers and crew experience mild hypoxia during flight equivalent to an 8\,000-ft elevation. Hypoxia is known to induce physiological and transcriptional changes that function together to permit normal cellular and tissue function at reduced oxygen (O2) levels. Short-term physiological responses include increased respiration and mild tachycardia; short-term transcriptional responses promote glycolysis and initiate angiogenesis\, hematopoiesis\, and other mitigating adaptations. Hypoxia also induces changes in nuclear chromatin structure\, altering histone methylation and chromatin accessibility profiles to promote or inhibit the transcription of specific genes. We assayed chromatin accessibility and gene expression in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) treated at 21%\, 15% (the equivalent of aircraft cabin pressurization)\, and 2% O2 (typical of tissue hypoxia). Large-scale changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression were observed at 15% O2\, including upregulation of histone genes and a reduction in intergenic and intronic chromatin accessibility. The 2% O2 treatment exhibited fewer changes in relation to the 21% O2 treatment and were mainly limited to the hypoxic response.

Hypoxia is known to induce physiological and transcriptional changes that function together to permit normal cellular and tissue function at reduced oxygen (O2) levels. Short-term physiological responses include increased respiration and mild tachycardia; short-term transcriptional responses promote glycolysis and initiate angiogenesis\, hematopoiesis\, and other mitigating adaptations. Hypoxia also induces changes in nuclear chromatin structure\, altering histone methylation and chromatin accessibility profiles to promote or inhibit the transcription of specific genes. We assayed chromatin accessibility and gene expression in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) treated at 21%\, 15% (the equivalent of aircraft cabin pressurization)\, and 2% O2 (typical of tissue hypoxia). Large-scale changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression were observed at 15% O2\, including upregulation of histone genes and a reduction in intergenic and intronic chromatin accessibility. The 2% O2 treatment exhibited fewer changes in relation to the 21% O2 treatment and were mainly limited to the hypoxic response. ANGPTL4\, an angiogenic regulator\, increased at 2% O2 but decreased at 15% O2. Further\, downregulation of the master regulator of the hypoxic response\, HIF1α\, was predicted at 15% O2 based on the expression status of the genes it regulates. In summary\, HBECs exposed to 15% O2 for 16 hours exhibit a large-scale transcriptional and nucleosomal response that appears to exclude most hypoxia regulators and\, instead\, triggers a response possibly promoting altitude acclimatization.,1199",2021-03-01,PDF,,,United States,,2021-09-13T19:51:57.611Z,,Tech Report,,United States.

In this work\, a streamlined methodology for building computationally efficient kinetic models of real fuels from shock tube experiments is developed and applied to a low cetane-number\, broad-boiling alternative jet fuel (termed C-4). A multi-wavelength laser absorption spectroscopy technique was used to determine species time-histories during the high-temperature pyrolysis of C-4\, and a batch gradient descent optimization routine built a hybrid-chemistry (HyChem) kinetic model from the measured data. The model was evaluated using combustor-relevant\, high-pressure ignition delay time measurements with satisfactory agreement. The present model enables predictive simulations of C-4 in practical environments\, while the underlying methodology described here can be readily extended to build kinetic models for a broad range of real fuels of interest.,1199",2019-07-01,PDF,,,United States,,2021-08-09T14:47:38.699Z,,Manuscript,Journal Article,Elsevier,application/pdf,25-j.combustflame.2019.06.024_pub_Streamlined_Approach_.pdf,1988474,urn:sha256:b21bbd106dae795d067327dd54aaeaf9e0e7276de30835badda33564dcd408f6,2019,,dot:53566,,"Pinkowski\, Nicolas H,Wang\, Yu,Cassady\, Sean J,Davidson\, David F,Hanson\, Ronald K",,,,1199,,,,,,,,,,,https://ntlrepository.blob.core.windows.net/lib/81000/81700/81714/25-j.combustflame.2019.06.024_pub_Streamlined_Approach_.pdf,,,,,"This manuscript is made available under the Elsevier user license,https://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/",United States.

dot:66408,,,"One of the primary impacts of aircraft noise on a community is its disruption of sleep. There are models that have been developed to predict the eﬀect of aircraft noise on sleep. However\, most of these models only predict the percentage of the population that is awakened. Markov and nonlinear dynamic models have been developed to predict an individual’s sleep structure during the night. However\, both of these models have limitations. The purpose of this research was to examine these sleep structure models to determine how they could be altered to predict the eﬀect of aircraft noise on sleep. Diﬀerent approaches for adding a noise level dependence to the Markov Model was explored and the modiﬁed model was validated by comparing predictions to behavioral awakening data. In order to determine how to add faster dynamics to the nonlinear dynamic sleep models it was necessary to have a more detailed sleep stage classiﬁcation than was available from visual scoring of sleep data. An automatic sleep stage classiﬁcation algorithm was developed which extracts diﬀerent features of polysomnography data including the occurrence of rapid eye movements (REMs)\, sleep spindles\, and slow wave sleep. Using these features an approach for classifying sleep stages every one second during the night was developed. From observation of the results of the sleep stage classiﬁcation\, it was determined how to add faster dynamics to the nonlinear dynamic model.

There are models that have been developed to predict the eﬀect of aircraft noise on sleep. However\, most of these models only predict the percentage of the population that is awakened. Markov and nonlinear dynamic models have been developed to predict an individual’s sleep structure during the night. However\, both of these models have limitations. The purpose of this research was to examine these sleep structure models to determine how they could be altered to predict the eﬀect of aircraft noise on sleep. Diﬀerent approaches for adding a noise level dependence to the Markov Model was explored and the modiﬁed model was validated by comparing predictions to behavioral awakening data. In order to determine how to add faster dynamics to the nonlinear dynamic sleep models it was necessary to have a more detailed sleep stage classiﬁcation than was available from visual scoring of sleep data. An automatic sleep stage classiﬁcation algorithm was developed which extracts diﬀerent features of polysomnography data including the occurrence of rapid eye movements (REMs)\, sleep spindles\, and slow wave sleep. Using these features an approach for classifying sleep stages every one second during the night was developed. From observation of the results of the sleep stage classiﬁcation\, it was determined how to add faster dynamics to the nonlinear dynamic model. Slow and fast REM activity are modeled separately and the activity in the gamma frequency band of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is used to model both spontaneous and noise-induced awakenings.

This project linked national data on Medicare enrollees and noise contours surrounding each of 89 airports to evaluate the relationship between aviation-related noise and hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease. A variety of exposure metrics for noise were constructed and these metrics were linked with zip code-level data on air pollution exposures\, population demographics\, socioeconomic factors\, and other individual-level and zip code-level covariates. Bayesian hierarchical models were constructed to estimate health risks associated with noise in the vicinity of each airport\, capturing health impacts in aggregate and by location. These models were used to consider the health effects of aircraft noise exposure on hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease in total and for multiple specific endpoints. Despite limitations related to potential misclassification of exposure\, there was a statistically significant association between exposure to aircraft noise and risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases among Medicare enrollees.",Active,Residential Exposure to Aircraft Noise and Hospital Admissions for Cardiovascular Diseases: Multi-Airport Retrospective Study,English,"Airport noise,Aircraft noise,Ambient noise,Cardiovascular diseases,Hospital emergency rooms,Physiological aspects,Time series analysis",2023-06-28T18:54:04.554Z,Federal Aviation Administration,English,Residential Exposure to Aircraft Noise and Hospital Admissions for Cardiovascular Diseases: Multi-Airport Retrospective Study,,"Airport noise,Aircraft noise,Ambient noise,Cardiovascular diseases,Hospital emergency rooms,Physiological aspects,Time series analysis","NMR Group,Boston University.

This project linked national data on Medicare enrollees and noise contours surrounding each of 89 airports to evaluate the relationship between aviation-related noise and hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease. A variety of exposure metrics for noise were constructed and these metrics were linked with zip code-level data on air pollution exposures\, population demographics\, socioeconomic factors\, and other individual-level and zip code-level covariates. Bayesian hierarchical models were constructed to estimate health risks associated with noise in the vicinity of each airport\, capturing health impacts in aggregate and by location. These models were used to consider the health effects of aircraft noise exposure on hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease in total and for multiple specific endpoints. Despite limitations related to potential misclassification of exposure\, there was a statistically significant association between exposure to aircraft noise and risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases among Medicare enrollees.",2013-10-06,PDF,,,United States,,2023-02-13T15:53:30.405Z,,Journal Article,,United States.

dot:72582,,"13-C-AJFE-UNC-014\, 016","The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) uses the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) to assess the impact of airport emissions on air quality in and around an airport. AEDT incorporates EPA's (Environmental Protection Agency) regulatory model\, AERMOD. The area/volume source algorithm in AERMOD is currently used to treat most airport sources including aircraft\, which contribute a major fraction of total airport emissions. Aircraft emissions have horizontal momentum corresponding to the forward thrust of the aircraft. In addition\, they have buoyancy corresponding to the heat rejected from the aircraft engine. These plume dynamics are not included in the latest version (v22112) of the area/volume source algorithm in AERMOD; the effects of the plume on ground-level concentrations are accounted through an initial plume height and width based on LIDAR observations at the end of runways. Model predictions based on this approach are likely to lead to overestimates of ground-level concentrations because they do not account for the increase of plume height with distance from the source. This paper proposes a plume rise formulation for aircraft emissions modeled with AERMOD. Plume rise is modeled using the weighted average of the characteristics of the aircraft that pass through the area/volume source during 1 h\, the averaging time used in AERMOD. The buoyancy parameter used to compute plume rise is estimated using the aircraft engine characteristics: thrust\, fuel burn rate\, the velocity of the aircraft\, air-fuel ratio\, and the engine bypass ratio. The proposed plume rise formulation for AERMOD is evaluated using SO2 observations from the 2012 Air Quality Source Apportionment Study (AQSAS) conducted at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

Atmospheric Environment. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.120106,The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) uses the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) to assess the impact of airport emissions on air quality in and around an airport. AEDT incorporates EPA's (Environmental Protection Agency) regulatory model\, AERMOD. The area/volume source algorithm in AERMOD is currently used to treat most airport sources including aircraft\, which contribute a major fraction of total airport emissions. Aircraft emissions have horizontal momentum corresponding to the forward thrust of the aircraft. In addition\, they have buoyancy corresponding to the heat rejected from the aircraft engine.

It is hypothesized that the type of secondary sonic booms resulting from a primary boom surface reflection could be substantially affected by the topography. A primary boom impacting a flat ocean will provide for a coherent reflected wave. In contrast\, a primary boom impacting typical surface topography of the land will produce a more diffuse reflection. Assuming additional propagation effects such as atmospheric absorption would be similar in the two cases\, the difference between coherent or diffuse reflections might explain why secondary booms reflection over typical land surfaces would produce decreased sound levels and therefore be less problematic than for the same booms reflecting over a calm ocean surface.",Active,The Role of Topography for Secondary Sonic Boom Reflection,English,"Sonic boom,Aerodynamic noise,Supersonic aircraft,Topography,Reflection,ASCENT,Secondary sonic boom",2024-05-22T15:03:19.078Z,Federal Aviation Administration,English,The Role of Topography for Secondary Sonic Boom Reflection,fa-2023.0361,"Sonic boom,Aerodynamic noise,Supersonic aircraft,Topography,Reflection,ASCENT,Secondary sonic boom","United States.

dot:73730,,13-C-AJFE-PU-004,"With rising concerns over commercial aviation’s contribution to global carbon emissions\, the aviation industry faces tremendous pressure to adopt advanced solutions for reducing its share of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. One near-term potential solution to mitigate this global emissions situation is to operate existing aircraft with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF); this solution requires almost no modification to current aircraft\, making it the “quickest” approach to reduce aviation carbon emissions\, albeit the actual impact will be determined by the degree to which airlines adopt and use SAF\, the ticket price impact of SAF\, and the future growth of travel demand. This article presents results that estimate the expected fleet-wide emissions of future airline operations using SAF considering various projected traveler demand and biofuel penetration/utilization levels. The work demonstrates an approach to make these predictions by modeling the behavior of a profit-seeking airline using the Fleet-Level Environmental Evaluation Tool (FLEET). Considering five future SAF scenarios and two future passenger demand projection scenarios\, FLEET estimates future fleet-level CO<sub>2</sub> emissions\, showcasing the possible upper and lower bounds on future aviation emissions when SAF is introduced for use in airline fleets. Results show that the future fleet-level CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for all scenarios with SAF are lower than the baseline scenario with no SAF\, for all demand projection scenarios. The passenger demand served and the trips flown for a given SAF scenario depends on the SAF price and the biofuel penetration levels. This shows that even if airlines serve a higher passenger demand for some future scenarios\, the carbon emissions could still be lower than the current baseline scenario where airlines only use conventional jet fuel.",Active,Estimating the Reduction in Future Fleet-Level CO2 Emissions from Sustainable Aviation Fuel,English,"Civil aircraft,Aircraft exhaust gases,Carbon dioxide,Aviation fuels,Fleet management,Forecasting,Predictive models,Biomass fuels,ASCENT",2024-04-18T19:59:32.082Z,Federal Aviation Administration,English,Estimating the Reduction in Future Fleet-Level CO2 Emissions from Sustainable Aviation Fuel,fenrg-09-771705,"Civil aircraft,Aircraft exhaust gases,Carbon dioxide,Aviation fuels,Fleet management,Forecasting,Predictive models,Biomass fuels,ASCENT","United States.

dot:77134,,,"Biofuels’ induced land-use change (ILUC) emissions have been widely studied over the past 15 years. Many studies have addressed uncertainties associated with these estimates. These studies have broadly examined uncertainties associated with the choice of economic models\, their assumptions and parameters\, and a few bio-physical variables. However\, uncertainties in land-use emission factors that represent the soil and vegetation carbon contents of various land types across the world and are used to estimate carbon fluxes due to land conversions are mostly overlooked. This paper calls attention to this important omission. It highlights some important sources of uncertainty in land-use emissions factors\, explores the range in these factors from established data sources\, and compares the influence of their variability on ILUC emissions for several sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathways. The estimated land-use changes for each pathway are taken from a well-known computable general equilibrium model\, GTAP-BIO. Two well-known carbon calculator models (CCLUB and AEZ-EF) that represent two different sets of emissions factors are used to convert the GTAP-BIO estimated land-use changes to ILUC emissions. The results show that the calculated ILUC emissions obtained from these carbon calculators for each examined SAF pathway are largely different\, even for the same amortization time horizon. For example\, the ILUC emissions values obtained from the AEZ-EF and CCLUB models for producing jet fuel from corn ethanol for a 25-year amortization period are 24.9 gCO2e/MJ and 15.96 gCO2e/MJ\, respectively. This represents a 60% difference between the results of these two carbon calculators for the same set of land-use changes.

However\, uncertainties in land-use emission factors that represent the soil and vegetation carbon contents of various land types across the world and are used to estimate carbon fluxes due to land conversions are mostly overlooked. This paper calls attention to this important omission. It highlights some important sources of uncertainty in land-use emissions factors\, explores the range in these factors from established data sources\, and compares the influence of their variability on ILUC emissions for several sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathways. The estimated land-use changes for each pathway are taken from a well-known computable general equilibrium model\, GTAP-BIO. Two well-known carbon calculator models (CCLUB and AEZ-EF) that represent two different sets of emissions factors are used to convert the GTAP-BIO estimated land-use changes to ILUC emissions. The results show that the calculated ILUC emissions obtained from these carbon calculators for each examined SAF pathway are largely different\, even for the same amortization time horizon. For example\, the ILUC emissions values obtained from the AEZ-EF and CCLUB models for producing jet fuel from corn ethanol for a 25-year amortization period are 24.9 gCO2e/MJ and 15.96 gCO2e/MJ\, respectively. This represents a 60% difference between the results of these two carbon calculators for the same set of land-use changes. The results show larger differences for other pathways as well.",Open Access; https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,,,"This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

dot:77368,,13-C-AJFE-WaSU-036,"Whether the feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) originates from agriculture or from waste streams\, life cycle CO2 emissions per unit enthalpy are lower for SAF than they are for petroleum distillates primarily because of differences on the front end such as fostered growth of crops or decreased demand for resources or acreage to manage wastes. This work\, however\, is concerned with what happens on the consumption side. Sustainable aviation fuel is required by ASTM D4054 / D7566 to meet a higher thermal stability standard than petroleum distillate fuels and this characteristic can be leveraged to improve energy efficiency in new engine or aircraft designs where a commitment has been made to burning fuel that meets a specification beyond that of conventional JetA. Beyond thermal stability\, non-drop-in SAF (Jet-X) developers have the opportunity to further increase the value of their product by infusing higher-than-conventional-JetA energy density (enthalpy per unit volume\, ED) into their SAF. Finally\, fuel specific energy (enthalpy per unit mass\, LHV) has a direct impact on aircraft efficiency which we have determined to be 0.43% per MJ/kg increase in LHV depending on the mission and aircraft model\, and this is applicable to both drop-in and non-drop-in applications.

Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels and Environment,Washington State University",Federal Aviation Administration,"Whether the feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) originates from agriculture or from waste streams\, life cycle CO2 emissions per unit enthalpy are lower for SAF than they are for petroleum distillates primarily because of differences on the front end such as fostered growth of crops or decreased demand for resources or acreage to manage wastes. This work\, however\, is concerned with what happens on the consumption side. Sustainable aviation fuel is required by ASTM D4054 / D7566 to meet a higher thermal stability standard than petroleum distillate fuels and this characteristic can be leveraged to improve energy efficiency in new engine or aircraft designs where a commitment has been made to burning fuel that meets a specification beyond that of conventional JetA. Beyond thermal stability\, non-drop-in SAF (Jet-X) developers have the opportunity to further increase the value of their product by infusing higher-than-conventional-JetA energy density (enthalpy per unit volume\, ED) into their SAF. Finally\, fuel specific energy (enthalpy per unit mass\, LHV) has a direct impact on aircraft efficiency which we have determined to be 0.43% per MJ/kg increase in LHV depending on the mission and aircraft model\, and this is applicable to both drop-in and non-drop-in applications. While higher energy density fuels may be leveraged in a new aircraft design to decrease drag and weight\, aircraft development potential with reduced tank volumes is typically constrained by other factors such as wing packaging\, passenger volume requirements and overall center of gravity and flight control law restrictions.",Open Access; https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,,,This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

dot:72623,,,"Due to the importance of understanding the aeroacoustics of rotorcraft with continually changing noise sources\, this paper presents a new technique for source separation from ground-based acoustic measurements. The source separation process is based on combining a time-domain de-Dopplerization method with the Vold-Kalman (VK) order tracking filter approach. This process can extract rotor harmonic noise even when the sources are continuously changing with time\, including impulsive events such as Blade Vortex Interaction (BVI) noise. The advantage of this approach over traditional methods such as harmonic averaging is that the phase and amplitude relationship of acoustic signals is preserved throughout the extraction process. The approach is applied to the measured acoustic data from a Bell 430 helicopter. The measured data were separated into main rotor harmonic\, tail rotor harmonic\, and broadband residual components. For steady-state conditions\, the extracted components could be de-propagated to form acoustic spheres showing the directivity of the separated main and tail rotor components. The source separation process was also applied to a maneuvering flight condition.

As noise certification standards for supersonic transport other than Concorde have not yet been developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization\, there is a need for a physics-based scaling rule for supersonic transport takeoff noise performance. Assuming supersonic transport takeoff noise levels are dominated by the engine mixed jet velocity and the aircraft-to-microphone propagation distance\, this paper presents a reduced order model for supersonic transport takeoff noise levels as a function of four scaling groups: cruise Mach number\, takeoff aerodynamic efficiency\, takeoff speed\, and number of installed engines. This paper finds that\, as cruise Mach number increases\, supersonic transport takeoff noise levels increase while their thrust cutback noise reduction potential decreases. Assuming constant aerodynamic efficiency\, takeoff speed\, and number of installed engines\, the takeoff noise levels\, and noise reduction potential of a Mach 2.2 aircraft are found to be∼15.3 dB higher and∼19.2 dB less compared to a Mach 1.4 aircraft\, respectively.

A human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation study evaluated how FPM cognitive skills and knowledge may degrade using a between-subjects design with B737 and A320 type-rated pilots. Degradation resulting from time away from flying was assessed by comparing 24 participants belonging to one of three groups: (1) individuals who meet requirements as defined in 14 CFR 121.439 pilot qualification for recent experience (n = 8)\, (2) individuals who used to qualify for recent experience but whose last flight in one of those aircraft was 6-12 months in the past (n = 8)\, or (3) individuals who used to qualify for recent experience but whose last flight in one of those aircraft was 12 – 24 months in the past (n = 8). The twenty-four participants completed seven scenarios in their aircraft type with twelve participants in the A320 and twelve participants in the B737. Study findings suggest that declarative knowledge of the functions and interactions of the Flight Management System (FMS) and auto flight systems\, including the flight director\, autopilot\, autothrottles\, and flight mode annunciations are more susceptible to degradation than other types of knowledge. The cognitive skills of collection\, integration\, and estimation appear more susceptible to degradation than prediction\, planning\, and communication. In addition\, pilots who had been away from flying for 12-24 months appeared to execute cognitive skills of information collection\, integration\, and estimation at a slightly slower frequency. Findings also suggest degradation in skill and decay in knowledge was not strictly due to time away from flying but may also result from other factors. Potential mitigations include continual reinforcement and training in self-assessment.",Active,Cognitive Skill Degradation: Phase III,English,"Air pilots,Aircraft operations,Automation,Cognition,Cognitive impairment,Flight paths",2025-01-21T16:42:02.499Z,Federal Aviation Administration,English,Cognitive Skill Degradation: Phase III,,"Air pilots,Aircraft operations,Automation,Cognition,Cognitive impairment,Flight paths",Honeywell Aerospace Advanced Technology,true,"2024-09-19; \,",,2024-09-19,PDF,,,United States,,2024-12-04T14:11:27.482Z,,Tech Report,Final Technical Report 8/19/2022 – 9/19/2024,United States.

A human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation study evaluated how FPM cognitive skills and knowledge may degrade using a between-subjects design with B737 and A320 type-rated pilots. Degradation resulting from time away from flying was assessed by comparing 24 participants belonging to one of three groups: (1) individuals who meet requirements as defined in 14 CFR 121.439 pilot qualification for recent experience (n = 8)\, (2) individuals who used to qualify for recent experience but whose last flight in one of those aircraft was 6-12 months in the past (n = 8)\, or (3) individuals who used to qualify for recent experience but whose last flight in one of those aircraft was 12 – 24 months in the past (n = 8). The twenty-four participants completed seven scenarios in their aircraft type with twelve participants in the A320 and twelve participants in the B737. Study findings suggest that declarative knowledge of the functions and interactions of the Flight Management System (FMS) and auto flight systems\, including the flight director\, autopilot\, autothrottles\, and flight mode annunciations are more susceptible to degradation than other types of knowledge. The cognitive skills of collection\, integration\, and estimation appear more susceptible to degradation than prediction\, planning\, and communication. In addition\, pilots who had been away from flying for 12-24 months appeared to execute cognitive skills of information collection\, integration\, and estimation at a slightly slower frequency. Findings also suggest degradation in skill and decay in knowledge was not strictly due to time away from flying but may also result from other factors. Potential mitigations include continual reinforcement and training in self-assessment.",,Final Technical Report 8/19/2022 – 9/19/2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review discusses the development and assessment of probabilistic fuel property prediction methods in use today and vital for the formulation of these next-generation SAFs. We discuss the rigorous quality assurance specifications necessary for aviation fuels before they can be integrated into the supply network\, with a particular emphasis on the stringent requirements for non-petroleum-based fuels or synthetic aviation turbine fuels. In this review\, the relative merit of predictions based on component data and predictions derived from other modeling approaches is discussed. A total of 16 scalar products between a concentration vector (mass\, mole\, or volume fraction) and a property vector can be used to estimate 31 properties\, counting the whole distillation curve as one property.

Office of Aviation Consumer Protection,"Federal Aviation Administration,Air Travel Consumer Report [Series]","The Air Travel Consumer Report is a monthly product of the Department of Transportation’s Office of Aviation Consumer Protection (OACP). The report is designed to assist consumers with information on the quality of services provided by the airlines. The report is divided into sections (Flight Delays\, Mishandled Baggage Wheelchairs and Scooters\, Oversales\, Consumer Complaints\, Customer Service Reports to the Transportation Security Administration\, and Airline Reports of the Loss\, Injury\, or Death of Animals During Air Transportation). The sections concerning flight delays\, mishandled baggage\, wheelchairs and scooters and oversales are based on data collected by the Department’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The section concerning consumer complaints is based on data compiled by the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection. The section concerning customer service reports to the Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is based on data provided by TSA. The section that deals with animal incidents during air transport is based on reports airlines are required to submit to the OACP. Each section of the report is preceded by a brief explanation of how to read and understand the information provided. The report normally is released by the end of the second week of each month. The report is available on-line at: https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/air-travel-consumer-reports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dot:79377,,13-C-AJFE-MIT,"The climate impact of persistent aircraft contrails is currently estimated to be comparable to that due to aviation-emitted CO2. A potential near-term and low-cost mitigation option is contrail avoidance\, which involves rerouting aircraft around ice-supersaturated regions\, preventing the formation of persistent contrails. Current forecasting methods for these regions of ice supersaturation have been found to be inaccurate when compared to in situ measurements. Further assessment and improvements of the quality of these predictions can be realized by comparison with observations of persistent contrails\, such as those found in satellite imagery. In order to further enable comparison between these observations and contrail predictions\, we develop a deep learning algorithm to estimate contrail altitudes based on GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) infrared imagery. This algorithm is trained using a dataset of 3267 contrails found within Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data and achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 570 m. The altitude estimation algorithm outputs probability distributions for the contrail top altitude in order to represent predictive uncertainty. The 95 % confidence intervals constructed using these distributions\, which are shown to contain approximately 95 % of the contrail data points\, are found to be 2.2 km thick on average. These intervals are found to be 34.1 % smaller than the 95 % confidence intervals constructed using flight altitude information alone\, which are 3.3 km thick on average.

dot:61314,,"LTRC Number: 11-3GT\, State Project Number: 736-99-1735","This research study aims at evaluating the benefits of using geosynthetics to reinforce/stabilize base aggregate layer/subgrade in pavements under repeated loading test conditions. For this purpose\, a total of six 80-ft long and 13 ft wide full-scale test lane sections were constructed\, among which two sections were reinforced by one or two layers of triaxial geogrids\, two sections were reinforced by one layer of high strength woven geotextile with different base layer thickness\, and the remaining two sections were the control sections. The field test sections were instrumented by a variety of sensors to measure the load- and environment-associated pavement response and performance. Two series of tests\, moving wheel load tests and cyclic plate load tests\, were conducted to investigate the field performance of geosynthetic reinforced/stabilized paved roads and to identify the differences in pavement response to moving wheel and cyclic plate loads. In addition\, six similar test sections were constructed inside a 6.5-ft × 6.5-ft × 5.5-ft test box. The test box sections were also instrumented by a variety of sensors to measure the load-associated pavement response and performance. Laboratory cyclic plate load tests were then conducted. The results of accelerated load testing on the pavement test sections demonstrate the benefits of using geosynthetics in reducing the permanent deformation in the pavement structure. The adjusted traffic benefit ratio (TBRadj) associated with geosynthetic reinforcement can be increased up to 2.12 at a rut depth of 0.75 in. for pavement constructed using 18 in. thick base layer on top of weak subgrade soil using two layers of geogrid reinforcement. The inclusion of geosynthetics results in redistributing the applied load to a wider area\, thus reducing the accumulated permanent deformation within the subgrade. The benefit of geosynthetics on reducing the maximum stress on top of subgrade is more appreciable at higher load levels. It was also found that the geosynthetics placed at the base-subgrade interface was able to improve the performance of both subgrade and base layers; by placing an additional layer of geogrid at the upper one-third of the base layer\, the performance of the base layer was further enhanced. While geosynthetics showed appreciable benefit on reducing the permanent deformation of the subgrade layer\, it showed less effect on the resilient properties of the subgrade layer. Drainage of the base layer has important effect on the performance of pavement structures for both unreinforced and reinforced lane sections.

The cost benefit becomes close for base thickness > 12 in. between using a single geosynthetic layer and a 12-in. cement/lime treated subgrade with a cement stabilized base.

For this purpose\, a total of six 80-ft long and 13 ft wide full-scale test lane sections were constructed\, among which two sections were reinforced by one or two layers of triaxial geogrids\, two sections were reinforced by one layer of high strength woven geotextile with different base layer thickness\, and the remaining two sections were the control sections. The field test sections were instrumented by a variety of sensors to measure the load- and environment-associated pavement response and performance. Two series of tests\, moving wheel load tests and cyclic plate load tests\, were conducted to investigate the field performance of geosynthetic reinforced/stabilized paved roads and to identify the differences in pavement response to moving wheel and cyclic plate loads. In addition\, six similar test sections were constructed inside a 6.5-ft × 6.5-ft × 5.5-ft test box. The test box sections were also instrumented by a variety of sensors to measure the load-associated pavement response and performance. Laboratory cyclic plate load tests were then conducted. The results of accelerated load testing on the pavement test sections demonstrate the benefits of using geosynthetics in reducing the permanent deformation in the pavement structure. The adjusted traffic benefit ratio (TBRadj) associated with geosynthetic reinforcement can be increased up to 2.12 at a rut depth of 0.75 in. for pavement constructed using 18 in. thick base layer on top of weak subgrade soil using two layers of geogrid reinforcement. The inclusion of geosynthetics results in redistributing the applied load to a wider area\, thus reducing the accumulated permanent deformation within the subgrade. The benefit of geosynthetics on reducing the maximum stress on top of subgrade is more appreciable at higher load levels. It was also found that the geosynthetics placed at the base-subgrade interface was able to improve the performance of both subgrade and base layers; by placing an additional layer of geogrid at the upper one-third of the base layer\, the performance of the base layer was further enhanced. While geosynthetics showed appreciable benefit on reducing the permanent deformation of the subgrade layer\, it showed less effect on the resilient properties of the subgrade layer. Drainage of the base layer has important effect on the performance of pavement structures for both unreinforced and reinforced lane sections. The life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) demonstrated the cost savings of using geosynthetics in pavement as compared to the unreinforced/untreated sections. However\, compared to the 12-in. cement/lime treated subgrade with the cement stabilized base pavement section\, the LCCA showed it is more cost effective to use geosynthetics for base thickness less than 12 in. (or < 15 in. of unreinforced aggregate base). The cost benefit becomes close for base thickness > 12 in. between using a single geosynthetic layer and a 12-in. cement/lime treated subgrade with a cement stabilized base. Moreover\, the cost benefit of using double geogrid layers exceeds the cost savings of a 12-in. treated subgrade with a cement stabilized base.,1318",2019-08-01,PDF,,,"Louisiana,United States",,2022-04-11T17:05:00.373Z,,Tech Report,"Final Report\, Dec 2010 -June 2018",Louisiana.

The present work characterizes physicochemical properties of reproductive materials (seeds and pods) from pongamia trees grown in different environments at five locations on the island of Oahu\, Hawaii\, USA. Proximate and ultimate analyses\, heating value\, and elemental composition of the seeds\, pods\, and de-oiled seed cake were determined.

dot:67141,,DTFAWA-10-C-00080,"Hypoxia awareness training is a standard facet of military aviator training that is performed to familiarize aviators with the symptoms of hypoxia. The three most common training devices are the hypobaric altitude chamber (AC)\, the normobaric reduced oxygen breathing device (ROBD)\, and the normobaric reduced oxygen breathing environment (ROBE). The AC creates hypoxic conditions using reduced atmospheric pressure. The ROBD and ROBE create normobaric hypoxic conditions by supplying a controlled reduced-oxygen gas mixture to trainees who don an aviation-style breathing mask or occupy a sealed chamber\, respectively. To determine if differences in the transcriptional response to each of these training devices exist\, blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) samples from ten volunteer participants were analyzed by microarray. The resulting gene expression measures were screened for significant changes across time points within and across device runs. Few genes were significant in these comparisons; the most significant differences between timepoints were observed in small nucleolar RNAs and noncoding RNAs\, as well as one microRNA and one transfer RNA. The transcriptional response to each training device differs slightly as determined by differences in transcription between time points.

The three most common training devices are the hypobaric altitude chamber (AC)\, the normobaric reduced oxygen breathing device (ROBD)\, and the normobaric reduced oxygen breathing environment (ROBE). The AC creates hypoxic conditions using reduced atmospheric pressure. The ROBD and ROBE create normobaric hypoxic conditions by supplying a controlled reduced-oxygen gas mixture to trainees who don an aviation-style breathing mask or occupy a sealed chamber\, respectively. To determine if differences in the transcriptional response to each of these training devices exist\, blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) samples from ten volunteer participants were analyzed by microarray. The resulting gene expression measures were screened for significant changes across time points within and across device runs. Few genes were significant in these comparisons; the most significant differences between timepoints were observed in small nucleolar RNAs and noncoding RNAs\, as well as one microRNA and one transfer RNA. The transcriptional response to each training device differs slightly as determined by differences in transcription between time points.

Forty-nine strikes (<1% of total) have resulted in a destroyed aircraft; thirty-three (67%) of these occurred at a General Aviation airport.,1252",2009-09-01,PDF,,,United States,,2017-08-29T18:29:31.588Z,,Statistical Report,,United States.

dot:77362,,"13-C-AJFE-MIT-062\, 72\, 93\, 98","The fundamental challenge facing today's aviation industry is to achieve net zero climate impacts while simultaneously sustaining growth and global connectivity. Aviation's impact on surface air quality\, which is comparable to aviation's climate impact when monetized\, further heightens this challenge. Prior studies have proposed solutions that aim to mitigate either aviation's climate or air quality impacts. No previous work has proposed an aircraft-energy system that simultaneously addresses both aviation's climate and air quality impacts. In this paper we (1) use a multi-disciplinary design approach to optimize aircraft and propulsion systems\, (2) estimate lifecycle costs and emissions of producing sustainable fuels including the embodied emissions associated with electricity generation and fuel production\, (3) use trajectory optimization to quantify the fuel penalty to avoid persistent contrail formation based on a full year of global flight operations (including\, for the first time\, contrail avoidance for a hydrogen burning aircraft)\, and (4) quantify climate and air quality benefits of the proposed solutions using a simplified climate model and sensitivities derived from a global chemistry transport model. We propagate uncertainties in environmental impacts using a Monte-Carlo approach. We use these models to propose and analyze near-zero environmental impact aircraft\, which we define as having net zero climate warming and a greater than 95% reduction in air quality impacts relative to present day. We contrast the environmental impacts of today's aircraft-energy system against one built around either “drop-in” fuels or hydrogen. We find that a “zero-impact” aircraft is possible using either hydrogen or power-to-liquid “drop-in” fuels. The proposed aircraft-energy systems reduce combined climate and air quality impacts by 99%\, with fuel costs increasing by 40% for hydrogen and 70% for power-to-liquid fueled aircraft relative to today's fleet (i.e.\, within the range of historical jet fuel price variation).

Postoperative side effects can affect the quality of vision and may be unacceptable in a,cockpit environment. The scientific literature suggests certain females (pregnant\, menopausal\, elderly) are more likely to,experience complications and have less than optimal visual performance after refractive surgery. This study reviews the,civil aeromedical experience with refractive surgery by gender. METHODS. A list of airmen with Federal Aviation,Administration (FAA)-specific pathology codes 130 (radial keratotomy) and 5179 (general eye pathology with surgical,prefix)\, during the period 1 January 1994 through 31 December 1996\, was generated from FAA medical databases.

The records were then stratified by class of medical certification,and gender\, and analyzed using demographic data extracted from FAA publications. RESULTS. There were 3\,761,airmen identified as having had refractive surgical procedures during the study period.

dot:24952,,,"Airports around the nation are considering expansion plans in order to meet increasing demand for aviation transport. There are increasing concerns\, as well\, about how and to what extent air pollutant emissions from airports contribute to local and regional air quality degradation and hence to negative impacts on human health and welfare. However\, it is difficult to quantify the amount\, transport\, and secondary conversion processes of aircraft emissions\, which usually comprise the bulk of airport-attributable emissions. This is due to four reasons: 1. Difficulty of determining the actual amounts of emissions from aircraft and characterizing the chemical speciation. 2. Difficulty of determining\, at the particle level\, the secondary chemical transformations that occur. 3. Difficulty in detection of the species and identification of the aircraft contribution in a region where air quality degradation is a consequence of emissions from multiple sources\, both natural and anthropogenic. For the project described in this report\, the technique of stable isotopic measurements was utilized in an attempt to develop and assess the impact of aircraft emissions in a region. The theme was\, “Are the aircraft emissions recognizable at the isotopic level in a region and are they separable from other sulfates?” To explore this theme\, the project team performed three measurement campaigns at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to sample aerosol sulfate and characterize the isotopic composition of oxygen atoms in the sulfate particles. It was hoped that aerosol sulfate from jet engines would be shown to have a distinct isotopic character in comparison to sulfate from other sources such as diesel engines\, aiding attribution of degraded air quality to jet aircraft sources. The premise that the oxygen isotopic composition of aerosol sulfate could be used to define jet contributions to a region was ultimately not conclusively supported by the study presented in this report. It appears that at low humidity an isotopic anomaly is preferentially created\, as observed in the first Aviation Alternative Fuels Experiment (AAFEX)\, thus identifying a jet aircraft engine. At the humidity of LAX however\, the presence of excess water on the aerosol surfaces dilutes the anomaly. Hence\, for assessment of the potential of the technique to be broadly applied\, it is likely that only low-humidity areas would be capable of providing the signature\, based upon the experiments conducted to-date. Furthermore\, unexpectedly low sulfate concentrations were observed in the study\, suggesting that jet engine exhaust SO2 oxidation occurs further away from LAX and optimal sampling sites in future studies would need to be done at further distances. However\, it is unlikely that increased distance between the source sulfur and the sampling monitors at LAX will show much isotopic anomaly in high humidity conditions (60+ %). Conceptually\, the potential remains for isotopic analysis to quantitatively address the contributions from aircraft jet engines to degraded air quality near airports. If future research is performed on this technique\, an airport in a dry environment must be selected as an initial candidate so that the methods initially explored in this report can be retried. Monitors may need to be located further away from the airport environment so that engine SO2 has more opportunity to become sulfate.",Active,Use of Isotopic Measurement and Analysis Approach to Uniquely Relate Aircraft Emissions to Changes in Ambient Air Quality,English,"Air quality management,Aircraft,Air pollution,Isotopes,Sulfates,Measurement,Aircraft exhaust gases,Research Hub,Aviation,Enviornment,Air,Emissions",2022-09-13T17:42:01.376Z,Federal Aviation Administration;Climate Change Clearinghouse,English,Use of Isotopic Measurement and Analysis Approach to Uniquely Relate Aircraft Emissions to Changes in Ambient Air Quality,PARTNER-COE-2011-003,,Partnership for Air Transportation Noise and Emissions Reduction,true,"2011-06-01; \,","Federal Aviation Administration;Climate Change Clearinghouse,2011,PDF,Tech Report,Thiemens\, Mark H.,Partnership for Air Transportation Noise and Emissions Reduction,United States.
